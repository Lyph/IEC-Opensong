Known issues with opensong (source: https://worshipleaderapp.com/en/opensong )

1. Make sure you have your projector or second screen plugged in and active before you start OpenSongOSX. OpenSong will not recognize the projector if you plug it in after OpenSongOSX has started (this is the same in Windows, BTW).

2. When you’re using dual screens you cannot hide the title bar across the top. It always stays there (this is tested from El Capitan [10.11] all the way back to Lion [10.7]).

3. OpenSong has a tendency to crash if you start a presentation, stop it and start it again (this is also tested from El Capitan [10.11] all the way back to Lion [10.7]). That being said, as long as you don’t pop in and out of Presentation mode too often, all should run well on a given Sunday.
