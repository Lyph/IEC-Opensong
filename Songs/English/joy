<lyrics>[V1]
.D                          A
 You give me joy that's unspeakable
.       Em            G
 And I like it, and I like it.
.D                      A
 Your love for me's irrestible;
.        Em                G
 I can't fight it, I can't fight it.

[V2]
.                         G                A
 If life is water, I was dry as the Tucson dirt.
.                          G             A
 If it's a gamble, I'd already lost my shirt.
.                           G              A
 If it's a journey, I was dazed without a clue.
.                            G                 A
 I flipped a &quot;U&quot; back to the first love I ever knew.

[C1]
.  D                          A
   You give me joy that's unspeakable
.        Em             G
   And I like it, and I like it.
.  D                      A
   Your love for me's irrestible;
.          Em                G
   I can't fight it, I can't fight it.
.  D                          A
   You carried the cross and took my shame;
.      Em            G
   I believe it, I believe it.
.  D                         A
   You shine your light of amazing grace;
.      Em            G
   I receive it, I receive it.

[V3]
.                           G            A
 If life's a battle, the invasion is complete.
.                            G               A
 If it's a rhythm, I have found the perfect beat.
.                            G              A
 If it's a Renaissance, I've got a new birthday.
.                 G                                   A
 The world don't give it and the world can't take it away.

[B1]
.  Em                       A
   I'm bowed and broken, everything's new.
.  Em                            A
   All that I need, you're like water to seed.
.                              G
   And how your love rights everything wrong,
.           A                   G
   In my weakness you're ever stronger,
.                            A
   Pulling me back where I belong.</lyrics>
