<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus Christ, our Blessed Savior, Turned away God's wrath forever; Suff'ring pains no tongue can tell, He saved us from the pains of hell.

[V2]
 To remind us that, to save us He hath died, His flesh He gave us With this bread, a quick'ning food, And with this wine, His precious blood.

[V3]
 Whoso to this board repaireth, Take good heed how He prepareth; Death instead of life shall He Receive who comes unworthily.

[V4]
 Praise the Father, God in heaven, Who such dainty food hath given, And for misdeeds thou hast done Gave to die His beloved Son.

[V5]
 Thou shalt hold with faith unshaken, That this food is to be taken By the sick who are distressed, By those whose heart is sin\oppressed.

[V6]
 To such grace and mercy turneth
 Every soul that truly mourneth;
 Art thou well? Avoid this board,
 Else thou reapest an ill reward.

[V7]
 Christ says: &quot;Come ye heavy-laden,
 I your weary hearts will gladden;
 They that are yet strong and well,
 Despise the best physician's skill.

[V8]
 Couldst thou earn thine own salvation,
 Useless were my death and passion;
 This feast is not spread for thee,
 If thine own helper thou wilt be.

[V9]
 If thou this believest truly,
 And confession makest duly,
 Thou a welcome guest art here,
 This heavenly food thy soul shall cheer.

[V10]
 But the fruits must not be missing,
 Love thy neighbor without ceasing,
 That true love let him receive,
 Which here to thee thy God doth give.</lyrics>
