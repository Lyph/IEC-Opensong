<lyrics>[V1]
 O wondrous type! O vision fair Of glory that the Church may share, Which Christ upon the mountain shows, where brighter than the sun He glows!

[V2]
 From age to age the tale declare, How with the three disciples there, Where Moses and Elijah meet, The Lord holds converse high and sweet.

[V3]
 The law and prophets there have place, Two chosen witnesses of grace; The Father's voice from out the cloud proclaims His only Son aloud.

[V4]
 With shining face and bright array, Christ deigns to manifest today What glory shall be theirs above who joy in God with perfect love.

[V5]
 And faithful hearts are raised on high by this great vision's mystery; For which in joyful strains we raise the voice of prayer, the hymn of praise.

[V6]
 O Father, with th'Eternal Son,
 and Holy Spirit, ever One,
 Vouchsafe to bring us by Thy grace
 to see Thy glory face to face.</lyrics>
