<title>Savior Crucified</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Verse: 1
 Blood of the Christ spilled on a tree
 Pours through the space between a sinner and king
 I was the one who failed Your name
 Taking for granted my savior's pain

[C1]
   Pre chorus:
   But Your grace reaches deeper than my every weakness
   Your love stretches father that all of my sorrow
   Your light shines brighter still

[C2]
   Chorus:
   My savior, crucified
   Conquered the grave and rose to life
   At the cross You changed my world
   Now I give it to You
   I'm Yours, I'm Yours

[V2]
 Verse: 2
 You knew the sin of those to come
 And died for the ones who would deny Your love
 I am the one who fails Your name
 Taking for granted my savior's pain</lyrics>
