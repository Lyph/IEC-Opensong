<lyrics>[V1]
 VERSE 1:
.         Em
 All these pieces
.          G
 Broken and scattered
.        Em
 In mercy gathered
.          G
 Mended and whole
.      Em
 Empty handed
.       G
 But not forsaken
.            D
 I've been set free
.            Em   D
 I've been set free

[V2]
 PRE-CHORUS 1:
.C
 Amazing grace
.    D
 How sweet the sound
.    Em                 C
 That saved a wretch like me
.  C
 I once was lost
.    D
 But now I am found
.   Em            C
 Was blind but now I see

[C1]
   CHORUS:
.                 G    D
   Oh I can see You now
.                 Em          C
   Oh I can see the love in Your eyes
.                G     D
   Laying Yourself down
.               Em        C
   Raising up the broken to life

[V3]
 VERSE 2:
 You take our failure
 You take our weakness
 You set Your treasure
 In jars of clay
 So take this heart Lord
 I'll be Your vessel
 The world to see Your life in me

[B1]
   INSTRUMENTAL:

[V4]
 PRE-CHORUS 2:
.G
 Amazing grace
.    D
 How sweet the sound
.    Em                 C
 That saved a wretch like me
.  G
 I once was lost
.    D
 But now I am found
.   Em            C
 Was blind but now I see</lyrics>
