 With my lips I will bless You
 With my mouth I'll sing Your praise
 With my eyes I long to see You
 Show me Your face
 With my eyes I long to hear You
 With my hands I long to touch You
 With all my heart I surrender to You

[C1]
   Let all that is within me
   bless Your holy Name
   Let all that is within me
   bless Your holy Name</lyrics>
