<lyrics>[V1]
 The people that in darkness sat A glorious light have seen; The light has shined on them who long In shades of death have been. In shades of death have been.

[V2]
 To hail Thee, Sun of Righteousness, The gath'ring nations come; They joy as when the reapers bear Their harvest treasures home. Their harvest treasures home.

[V3]
 For Thou their burden dost remove And break the tyrant's rod As in the day when Midian fell Before the sword of God. Before the sword of God.

[V4]
 To us a Child of hope is born, To us a Son is giv'n, And on His shoulder ever rests All pow'r in earth and heav'n. All pow'r in earth and heav'n.

[V5]
 His name shall be the Prince of Peace, The Everlasting Lord, The Wonderful, the Counselor. The God by all adored. The God by all adored.

[V6]
 His righteous government and power
 Shall over all extend;
 On judgment and on justice based,
 His reign shall have no end.

[V7]
 Lord Jesus, reign in us, we pray,
 And make us Thine alone,
 Who with the Father ever art
 And Holy Spirit, one.</lyrics>
