<lyrics>[V1]
 Who has held the oceans in His hands?
 Who has numbered every grain of sand?
 Kings and nations tremble at His voice
 All creation rises to rejoice

[C1]
   Behold our God, seated on His throne
   Come, let us adore
   Him Behold our King, nothing can compare
   Come, let us adore Him!

[V2]
 Who has given counsel to the Lord?
 Who can question any of His words?
 Who can teach the One who knows all things?
 Who can fathom all His wondrous deeds?

[V3]
 Who has felt the nails upon His hands
 Bearing all the guilt of sinful man?
 God eternal, humbled to the grave
 Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign!

[B1]
   // You will reign forever (Let Your glory fill the earth) //</lyrics>
