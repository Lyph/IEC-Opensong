.D
 A corner office was his dream

[V2]
 More like a prison now it seems
.G
 Somewhere on the corporate climb

[V3]
 He left his warrior behind
.D
 Now hes just a worker at a daily grind

[V4]
 Steals his years and numbs his mind
.G                       Em
 His strength is fading, his dreams are blind

[V5]
 This is not the life he had in mind

[V6]
.D
 She lies awake cause hes up all night

[V7]
 Staring at a screen that tells him lies
.G
 That the grass is greener on the other side
.D
 So shes at the gym fighting off the years

[V8]
 To be young again and calm her fears
.G
 That shell never be enough for him
.Em
 Just as a young man catches her eye

[V9]
.                          D
 Now they're trapped in their own worlds, in their own wars
.       D7m/C#             D
 With their cell phones and the closed doors
.   G          D7m/C#        D
 It's funny how quiet and peaceful that it seems
.G
 But they're all alone together
.Em
 In the house of their dreams

[V10]
.D
 Little sister, shes a sixteen-year-old princess

[V11]
 Lost somewhere between the swing set
.   G
 And her brand new crushs chariot awaits
.    D
 And big brothers rooms glowing with trophies that shout his name
.                     G
 But he'd trade all his high school fame
.                   Em
 For some backyard catch with his hero again

[V12]
.                G           D
 Now they're trapped in their own worlds, in their own wars
.       D7m/C#             D
 With their cell phones and the closed doors
.   G          D7m/C#        D
 It's funny how quiet and peaceful that it seems
.G
 But they're all alone together
.Em
 In the house of their dreams

[V13]
.D
 So now they're all dressed up in sunday best
 Sit up straight just like the rest
.G                                 D
 And they sing the songs of peace and rest that Jesus freely gives

[V14]
 And then their kids look up as daddy stands

[V15]
 And he takes his bride with trembling hands
.G
 Brother kneels at his fathers side as princess looks in the mothers eyes
.                       Em
 Their tears tear down the walls as daddy prays

[V16]
.                G           D
 Now they're trapped in their own worlds, in their own wars
.       D7m/C#             D
 With their cell phones and the closed doors
.   G          D7m/C#        D
 It's funny how quiet and peaceful that it seems
.G
 But they're all alone together
.Em
