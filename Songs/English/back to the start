 Waiting for You
 Be my rescue
 Find me
 Bring me out alive
 I will surrender
 Back to the start
 Where You found me
 I give You my heart again
 Take everything
 I'm all I can bring
 I'm coming home again
 Savior save me
 Darkness leave me
 Healer burn away this pain
 Hold me
 I'm a fire I'm note a flame
 Whooaa
 I give You my heart again
 I'm coming back to the start, to the start
 I'm coming back to You
 I'm running back to Your heart, to Your heart
 I'm running back to You
 You never stop loving us
 No matter how far we were
 You never give up on us
 All of heaven shout
 Let the future begin
 A feel alive
 I come alive
 I am alive
 On God's Great dance floor</lyrics>
