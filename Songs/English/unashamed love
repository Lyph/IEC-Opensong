.       G                             C6
 You're callin' me to lay aside the worries of my day,
.   Em7                          C
 To quiet down my busy mind and find a hiding place.
. G/B   C2 .    Em7    C2
 Worthy!You are worthy!
.   G                           C6
 I open up my heart and let my spirit worship Yours.
.  Em7                           C
 I open up my mouth and let a song of praise come forth.
. G/B   C2 .    Em7    C2
 Worthy!You are worthy!

[C1]
.  G                     C2
   Of a childlike faith, of my honest praise,
.      Em7                C2
   And of my unashamed love.
.  G
   Of a holy life,
.  C2
   of my sacrifice,
.      Em7              G/C
   And of my unashamed love.

[B1]
.    G    C2 .    G      C2
   Worthy!You are worthy!
.    G    C2 .    Em7    C2
   Worthy!You are worthy!</lyrics>
