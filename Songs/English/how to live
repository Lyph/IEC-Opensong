 Verse 1:
.       Hm          G              D                A/C#
 Oh, my God, here I am, here's my soul in front of You,
.              Hm                  G              D            A/C#
 I don't have words, I don't have tears and all my hope is in You
.            Hm                  G             D           A/C#
 You know my life, You know my way and every my step You know
.           Hm            G                 D                A/C#
 So help me God to understand, what can I do? Where should I go?

[C1]
   Chorus:
.  Hm             D                           G
   Tell me how to live when I don't see the sense
.                        Em
   When I don't see the sense
.  Hm                    D                           G
   Show me where is the hand that will help me to stand.
.                        Em
   That will help me to stand.

[V2]
 Verse 2:
 How to see we are blind, how to hear we are deaf
 to feel, if our mind cannot love and forgive?

[B1]
   Bridge:
.  G                                        F#m
   Tell me how to live when I don't see the sense
.  Em
   When I don't see the sense, when I don't see
.  G                                               F#m
   Show me where is the hand that will help me to stand.
.  Em
   That will help me to stand.</lyrics>
