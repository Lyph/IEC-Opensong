<lyrics>[V1]
 Up Calvary's mountain one dreadful morn
 Walked Christ my Savior, weary and worn
 Facing for sinners death on the cross
 That He might save them from endless loss

[C1]
   Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer
   Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree
   Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading
   Blind and unheeding, dying for me

[V2]
 &quot;Father, forgive them,&quot; my Savior prayed
 Even while His lifeblood flowed fast away
 Praying for sinners while in such woe
 No one but Jesus ever loved so

[V3]
 Oh how I love Him, Savior and friend
 How can my praises ever find end
 Through years unnumbered on Heaven's shore
 My songs shall praise Him forevermore</lyrics>
