<lyrics>[V1]
 Thou, who at Thy first Eucharist didst pray That all Thy Church might be forever one, Grant us at ev'ry Eucharist to say With longing heart and soul, &quot;Thy will be done.&quot; O may we all one bread, one body be, Through this blest sacrament of unity.

[V2]
 For all Thy Church, O Lord, we intercede; Make Thou our sad divisions soon to cease; Draw us the nearer each to each, we plead, By drawing all to Thee, O Prince of Peace; Thus may we all one bread, one body be, Through this blest sacrament of unity.

[V3]
 We pray Thee too for wand'rers from Thy fold; O bring them back, good Shepherd of the sheep, Back to the faith which saints believed of old, Back to the Church which still that faith doth keep; Soon may we all one bread, one body be, Through this blest sacrament of unity.

[V4]
 So, Lord, at length when sacraments shall cease, May we be one with all Thy Church above, One with Thy saints in one unbroken peace, One with Thy saints in one unbounded love; More bless√®d still, in peace and love to be One with the Trinity in unity.</lyrics>
