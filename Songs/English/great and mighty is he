<title>Great and Mighty is He</title>
<lyrics>[C1]
   Great and mighty is He,
   Great and mighty is He;
   Clothed in glory arrayed in splendor,
   Great and mighty is He.

[V1]
 Let us lift His name up high,
 Celebrate His grace;
 For He has redeemed our lives,
 And He reigns on high.</lyrics>
</song>
