.       E      B/D#
 Here I am, once again.
.  C#m                        A
 I pour out my heart for I know that You hear
.    E              B/D#
 Ev'ry cry; You are listening
.   C#m               A
 No matter what state my heart is in.
.            E       B/D#
 You are faithful to answer

 With words that are true and a hope that is real.
.   E         B/D#
 As I feel Your touch,
.C#m                    A
 You bring a freedom to all that's within.
