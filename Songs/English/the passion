<lyrics>[V1]
 VERSE 1:
 The passion of our Saviour
 The mercy of our God
 The cross that leaves no question
 Of the measure of His love

[C1]
   CHORUS:
   Our chains are gone
   Our debt is paid
   The cross has overthrown the grave
   For Jesus' blood that sets us free
   Means death to death
   And life for me

[V2]
 VERSE 2:
 The Innocent judged guilty
 While the guilty one walks free
 Death would be His portion
 And our portion liberty

[B1]
   BRIDGE:
   I give my whole life
   To honour this love
   By the Lamb who was slain
   I'm forgiven

[V3]
 The sinner's Saviour
 Crown Him forever
 For the Lamb who was slain
 He is risen

[V4]
