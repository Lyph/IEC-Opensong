<lyrics>[V1]
.Bm        F#m7/A         G       D  A
 Saviour I come; Quiet my soul. Remember
.Bm           F#m7/A                       G           D  A
 Redemption's hill where Your blood was spilled for my ransom.

[P1]
.  Em7          Asus       A       Bm      A      Gmaj7
   Everything I once held dear, I count it all as loss.

[C1]
.                       Gmaj7      D           A
   Lead me to the cross where Your Love poured out.
.                 Gmaj7          D      A
   Bring me to my knees, Lord, I lay me down.
.              Gmaj7     D       A
   Rid me of myself, I belong to You.
.          Em9 G       A      Bm
   Oh lead me, lead me to the cross.

[V2]
 You were as I, tempted and tried, human.
 The Word became flesh, bore my sin and death; now You're risen.

[B1]
.          D     Gmaj7A
   To Your Heart.
.          D     GA
   To Your Heart.
.                  D     Gmaj7A
   Lead me to Your Heart.
.                  D     GA
   Lead me to Your Heart.</lyrics>
