<lyrics>[V1]
.G                    Em
 Letting go of every single dream I lay each one down at your feet
.C               D
 Every moment of my wandering Never changes what you see
.G                       Em
 I've tried to win this war I confess My hands are weary I need your rest
.C                   D
 Mighty warrior king of the fight No matter what I face you're by my side

[C1]
   Chorus:
.  G                D
   When you don't move the mountains I'm needing you to move
.  Em                C
   When you don't part the waters I wish I could walk through
.  G                D
   When you don't give the answers as I cry out to you
.  Em                C         G          D
   I will trust I will trust I will trust in you

[V2]
.G                     Em
 Truth is you know what tomorrow brings There's not a day ahead you have not seen
.C                         D
 So in all things be my life and breath I want what you want lord and nothing less

[C2]
   Chorus:
.  G                D
   When you don't move the mountains I'm needing you to move
.  Em                C
   When you don't part the waters I wish I could walk through
.  G                D
   When you don't give the answers as I cry out to you
.  Em                C         G          D
   I will trust I will trust I will trust in you

[V3]
.C                 D
 You are my strength and comfort You are my steady hand
.Em                C
 You are my firm foundation The rock on which I stand
.C               D
 Your ways are always higher Your plans are always good
.Em                   C
 There's not a place where I'll go you've not already stood

[C3]
   Chorus:
.  G                D
   When you don't move the mountains I'm needing you to move
.  Em                C
   When you don't part the waters I wish I could walk through
.  G                D
   When you don't give the answers as I cry out to you
.  Em                C         G          D
   I will trust I will trust I will trust in you</lyrics>
