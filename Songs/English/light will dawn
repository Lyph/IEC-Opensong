 As Earth starts to shake
 The sleeping awake
 Dawn starts to break
 And life will be forever changed

[V2]
 Despite what they say
 Your love will remain
 You'll come again
 And on that day the son will reign

[V3]
 Though darkness surrounds
 The Lord will arise and light will dawn across this land

[V4]
 In joy and in pain
 I trust in Your name
 My rock, you sustain
 You're faithful and you never change

[V5]
 You are really coming back
 And I know I will see You face to face my God
 One day every knee will bow
 And one day every tongue confess that You are God

[V6]
 And I believe that I will see
 The goodness of The Lord while I'm breathing
 So I will trust upon Your name
 You are my hope and my strength</lyrics>
