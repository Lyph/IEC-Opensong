.  E                        C#m            A                 E  B
 A choice is set before you now, living or dying blessing or cursing;
.    E                      C#m                      A                        E  B
 And now the time has come around, to turn from your fighting and rest in His mercy.

.E                            C#m                     A                    E B
 Trust the Lord with all your heart, with all of your soul and all of your being;
.     E              C#m                 A             E  B
 Hold on listen and obey, surrender your life into His keeping.

   Choose life, that you might live, the life that He gives,
.                  B
   He gives you forever;
.         E         B           C#m            G#            A
   Choose life, the way that is true, from the One who chose you,
.                 B
   Your Father in heaven;
.         E
   Choose life.

[B1]
.  A                               G#       C#m     B/D#
   And the weight that you're under will be lifted away;
.  A                        G#    C#m             B/D#
   And the world will wonder what happened here today;
.             A                     B
   And you'll stand right there and say...</lyrics>
