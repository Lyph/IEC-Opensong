 Now praise we Christ, the Holy One, The spotless virgin Mary's Son, Far as the bless√©d sun doth shine E'en to the world's remote confine

[V2]
 He, who Himself all things did make, A servant's form vouchsafed to take, That He as man mankind might win, And save His creatures from their sin.

[V3]
 The grace of God, th'Almighty Lord, On the chaste mother was outpoured a virgin pure and undefiled In wondrous wise conceived a child.

[V4]
 The holy maid became th'abode And temple of the living God; And she, who knew not man, was blest With God's own Word made manifest.

[V5]
 The noble mother bare a Son, For so did Gabriel's promise run, Whom John confessed and leapt with joy, Ere yet the mother knew her boy.

[V6]
 In a rude manger, stretched on hay, In poverty content He lay;
 With milk was fed the Lord of all, Who feeds the ravens when they call.

[V7]
 Th' angelic choir rejoice, and raise Their voice to God in songs of praise;
 To humble shepherds is proclaimed The Shepherd who the world hath framed.

[V8]
 Honor to Thee, O Christ, be paid, Pure offspring of a holy maid,
 With Father and with Holy Ghost, Till time in time's abyss be lost.</lyrics>
