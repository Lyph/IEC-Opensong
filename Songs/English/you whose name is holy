<lyrics>[V1]
 You, whose name is holy
 You are welcome here
 Welcome, welcome
 You have come into our hearts
 Welcome, welcome
 You have brought us joy
 With your splendor you have brought
 A great light to us

[V2]
 You, whose name is holy
 You have favored us
 You favored, you favored
 You have favored us
 You favored us
 You have brought your Spirit
 You gave yourself who is love
 And benevolence

[V3]
 You, whose name is holy
 Welcome here
 Welcome, you are here
 Welcome, you have brought joy
 Welcome, welcome
 You have brought us joy
 Love, joy, happiness and peace
 You have brought to us</lyrics>
