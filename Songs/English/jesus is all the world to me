<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus is all the world to me, My life, my joy, my all; He is my strength from day to day, Without Him I would fall. When I am sad, to Him I go, No other one can cheer me so; When I am sad, He makes me glad, He's my friend.

[V2]
 Jesus is all the world to me, my friend in trials sore; I go to Him for blessings and He gives them ov'r and o'er. He sends the sunshine and the rain, He sends the harvest's golden grain; Sunshine and rain, harvest of grain, He's my friend.

[V3]
 Jesus is all the world to me, and true to Him I'll be; O how could I this friend deny, when He's so true to me? Following Him I know I'm right, He watches o'er me day and night; Following Him, by day and night, He's my friend.

[V4]
 Jesus is all the world to me, I want no better friend; I trust Him now, I'll trust Him when Life's fleeting days shall end. Beautiful life with such a friend; beautiful life that has no end; Eternal life, eternal joy, He's my friend.</lyrics>
