<lyrics>[V1]
 Neither life nor death nor angels
 Can ever separate us from Your love.
 No principalities nor present things nor things to come nor power.

[C1]
   Nothing can separate us, nothing can separate us from Your
   Nothing can separate us, nothing can separate us from Your love.

[V2]
 No tribulation can keep us down,
 Because in you we know we'll overcome.
 Neither height nor depth
 Nor anything created
 Can ever separate us from the love of God.

[B1]
   In all these things we are more than conquerors.
   For in all these things we are more than conquerors
   Because of You and because You love us.</lyrics>
