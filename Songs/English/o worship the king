<lyrics>[V1]
.  D                     G        A
 O worship the King, all glorious above,
.    D                   G         D
 And gratefully sing His wonderful love.
.    A                                   G
 Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,
.D                              G        D
 Pavillioned in splendor and girded with praise!

[V2]
 O tell of His might, O sing of His grace,
 Whose robe is the light and canopy space.
 His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form
 And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.

[C1]
.  G                 A         D
   You alone are the Matchless King.
.  G                   A     D
   To You alone be all majesty.
.  G
   Your glories and wonders
.       A            D
   What tongue can recite?
.      G                  D
   You breathe in the air.
.                   G     A
   You shine in the light.

[V3]
 O measureless might, ineffable love,
 While angels delight to worship above.
 Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end!
 Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!</lyrics>
