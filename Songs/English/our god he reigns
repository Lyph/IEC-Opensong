<lyrics>[V1]
 The God of time and eternity
 Orchestrates all history
 Our God He reigns forever
 At His command the whole world was made
 In His love He came down to save
 Our God He reigns forever
 Our God He reigns forever

[C1]
   Our God He reigns, our God He reigns
   Now and forever, over all things
   The first and last word will always be His
   Hallelujah, praise the God who reigns!

[V2]
 The Father's plan of amazing grace;
 Pierced hands for a sinful race
 Our God He reigns forever
 We exchange through His life and death
 Guilty stains for His righteousness
 Our God He reigns forever
 Our God He reigns forever

[V3]
 He's seated high in authority
 Yet lives inside of you and me
 Our God He reigns forever
 Earthly power will fade away
 But Jesus rule, it will never end
 Our God He reigns forever
 Our God He reigns forever

[B1]
   Our God reigns
   Our God reigns
   Our God reigns
   Hallelujah, praise the God who reigns!</lyrics>
