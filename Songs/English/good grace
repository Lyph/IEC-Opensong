<lyrics>[V1]
 People come together, strange as neighbours our blood is one
 Children of generations of every nation of kingdom come

[C1]
   Don't let your heart be troubled, Hold your head up high
   Don't fear no evil, Fix your eyes on this one truth;
   God is madly in love with you, So take courage
   Hold on, Be strong, Remember where our help comes from

[V2]
 Interlude:
 Whoa oh! Whoa oh oh... Whoa oh oh...oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
 Whoa oh! Whoa oh oh... Whoa oh oh...oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...

[V3]
 Jesus, our redemption, our salvation, is in His blood
 Jesus, Light of heaven, Friend forever, His kingdom come

[B1]
   Swing wide all you heavens, Let the praise go up, as the walls come down
   All creation, everything with breath repeat the sound.
   All His children, clean hands, pure hearts, good grace, good God
   His Name is Jesus

[V4]
 Jesus, our redemption, our salvation, is in His blood
 Jesus, Light of heaven, Friend forever, His kingdom come</lyrics>
