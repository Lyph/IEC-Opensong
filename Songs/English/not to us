.A                                F#m7
 The cross before me, the world behind.
 No turning back, raise the banner high.
.Esus         D2                A  Asus
 It's not for me; it's all for You.

 Let the heavens shake and split the sky.

 Let the people clap their hands and cry.
.Esus           D2              A  AsusA

 Our hearts unfold before Your throne.
 The only place for those who know:

 Send Your holy fire on this offering.
 Let our worship burn for the world to see.
 It's not for us; it's all for You, for You.
