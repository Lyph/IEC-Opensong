 VERSE: 1
 When I was searching Your love was never far
 You made a way to get to me
 You were the whisper Leading me to Your heart
 Forever I belong to You

[C1]
   PRE CHORUS:
   Now I can see clearly My God You are for me
   You won't let go

[C2]
   CHORUS:
   Your love won't let me down
   And I know it's true yeah I know that
   Your love is all around
   I believe in You holding on to You
   Holding on and I know You will never fail
   I want all of You You never change
   Your love won't let me down
   Love won't let me down

[V2]
 VERSE: 2
 Right when I need You You listen as I pray
 You'd leave the ninety-nine for me
 You paint the sky with Promises of Your grace
 So I would find my way to You</lyrics>
