.A       E                   F#m
 Blessed be Your name in the land that is
.D
 plentiful
.           A           E
 Where Your streams of abundance flow
.D
 Blessed be Your name
.A           E
 And blessed be Your name
.         F#m          D
 When I'm found in the desert place
.         A                E
 Though I walk through the wilderness
.D
 Blessed be Your name

[P1]
.  A                E
     Every blessing You pour out
.      F#m           D
   I'll turn back to praise
.  A                       E
     And when the darkness closes in, Lord
.  F#m              D
       Still I will say:

[C1]
.                 A           E
   Blessed be the name of the Lord
.                 F#m    D
   Blessed be Your name
.                 A           E
   Blessed be the name of the Lord
.                  F#m       D
   Blessed be Your glorious name

[V2]
.A       E
 Blessed be Your name
.         F#m           D
 When the sun's shining down on me
.         A               E
 When the world's &quot;all as it should be&quot;
.D
 Blessed be Your name
.A           E
 And blessed be Your name
.       F#m              D
 On the road marked with suffering
.               A           E
 Though there's pain in the offering
.D
 Blessed be Your name

[B1]
.      A              E
   You give and take away,
.      F#m            D
   You give and take away
.     A                    E
   My heart will choose to say
.        F#m             D
   Lord, Blessed be Your name</lyrics>
