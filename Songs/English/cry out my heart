 Cry out, my heart
 Cry out to the heav'ns
 Rise up, my voice
 Raise up to glory
 You are royalty
 I'm but a speck
 You are the sea
 I'm but a drop

[V2]
 Cry out, my heart
 Cry out with the Spirit
 Raise your voice
 Rise up with Christ
 You are in me
 Where am I?
 You are the cure
 I'm in distress

[V3]
 Cry out, my heart
 Cry out with love
 Cry out, my heart
 Cry out to the heav'ns</lyrics>
