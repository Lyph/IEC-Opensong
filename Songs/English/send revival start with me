.      C                          F
 We're looking to Your promise of old,

 You will come and heal our land,
.         C              F    (C)
 You will come, You will come.

 That if we turn and look to Your face,

 You will come and heal our land,

   For I am one of unclean lips,
.         F                  C
   And my eyes have seen the King;
.       F            C
   Your glory I have glimpsed,
.       F C/E   Dm    Fsus2 C
   Send revival start with  me.</lyrics>
