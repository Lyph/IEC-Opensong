<lyrics>[V1]
 What do you think about when you look at me
 I know were not the fairy tale you dreamed wed be
 You wore the veil, you walked the aisle, you took my hand
 And we dove into a mystery

[V2]
 How I wish we could go back to simpler times
 Before all our scars and all our secrets were in the light
 Now on this hallowed ground, we've drawn the battle lines
 Will we make it through the night

[P1]
   Its going to take much more than promises this time
   Only God can change our minds

[C1]
   Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete
   Could we just be broken together
   If you can bring your shattered dreams and I'll bring mine
   Could healing still be spoken and save us
   The only way well last forever is broken together

[V3]
 How it must have been so lonely by my side
 We were building kingdoms and chasing dreams and left love behind
 I'm praying God will help our broken hearts align
 And we won't give up the fight

[P2]
   Its going to take much more than promises this time
   Only God can change our minds

[C2]
   Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete
   Could we just be broken together
   If you can bring your shattered dreams and I'll bring mine
   Could healing still be spoken and save us
   The only way well last forever is broken together

[C3]
   Maybe you and I were never meant to be complete
   Could we just be broken together
   If you can bring your shattered dreams and I'll bring mine
   Could healing still be spoken and save us
   The only way well last forever is broken together</lyrics>
