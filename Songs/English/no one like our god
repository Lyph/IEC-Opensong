 What is this love that won't relent
 That's calling out with heaven's breath
 Who's reaching wide to save our souls
 Only You
 What is this grace that makes no sense
 That we could never recompense
 Who gives us all a second chance
 Only You, Only You, Only You

[C1]
   There is no one like our God
   There is no one like our God
   There is no other God who can save
   There is no one like our God

[V2]
 Who hung the stars upon the night
 And showed the sun how bright to shine
 Who shaped with world within His hands
 Only you
 Who set the sky upon the hills
 And told the waters to be still
 Who spoke to form the universe
 Only You, Only You, Only You

[B1]
   No height or depth can stand between us
   No power on earth or all creation
   No life or death can separate us from Your love</lyrics>
