 Father, You know me and You love me
 Oh Father, I was made to give You glory

[V2]
 And like a jar of sweet perfume
 I will give my life to You
 All my love, poured out on the feet of the Lord

[V3]
 Jesus, there is no one like You
 Oh Jesus, I am longing to be with You

[V4]
 Spirit, fill me with your love again
 Holy Spirit, come and lead me into truth again</lyrics>
