<lyrics>[V1]
 Why You ever chose me Has always been a mystery
 All my life I've been told I belong at the end of the line
 With all the other Not-Quites with all the Never-Get-It-Rignts
 But it turns out we're the ones You've been looking for all this time

[C1]
   'Cause I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody
   All about Somebody who saved my soul
   Ever since You rescued me You gave my heart a song to sing
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus

[V2]
 Moses had stage fright and David brought a rock to a sword fight
 You picked 12 outsiders nobody would've chosen
 And You changed the world well, the moral of the story is everybody's got a purpose
 So when I hear that devil start talking to me, saying
 &quot;Who do you think you are&quot;
 I say...

[C2]
   I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody
   All about Somebody who saved my soul
   Ever since You rescued me You gave my heart a song to sing
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus

[B1]
   So let me go down down down in history
   As another blood-bought faithful member of the family
   And if they all forget my name, well, that's fine with me
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus

[C3]
   'Cause I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody
   All about Somebody who saved my soul
   Ever since You rescued me You gave my heart a song to sing
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus
   I'm living for the world to see nobody but Jesus</lyrics>
