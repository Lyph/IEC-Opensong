<title>Sing (Your Love)</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 It used to be darkness
 Without you I
 I lived my life in blindness
 But now I'm found

[V2]
 And I'll sing, sing I love you so
 And I'll sing
 Because the world can't take away
 Your love

[V3]
 Found me in weakness
 Broken
 You came to me in kindness
 And now I live

[V4]
 I give my life for you Lord
 For all you've done</lyrics>
</song>
