<lyrics>[V1]
.B5                             D5
 Lavishly our lives are wasted, humbleness is left untasted,
.G5                                     D
 You can't live your life to please yourself, yeah;
.B5                             D5
 That's a tip from my mistake, exactly what it doesn't take,
.   G5                            B5     A5
 To win you've got to come in last place.
.   D                     E                  Gmaj7           D
 To live your life you've got to lose it, And all the losers get a crown.

[C1]
.        D                               E7
   I get down, and He lifts me up, I get down, and He lifts me up,
.        G
   I get down, and He lifts me up,
.        D
   I get down.

[V2]
.B5                             D5
 All I need's another day where I can't seem to get away
.G5                                D
 From the many things that drag me down, yeah;
.    B5                                  D5
 I'm sure you've had a day like me where nothing seems to set you free,
.         G5                           B5   A5
 From the burdens you can't carry all alone.
.D                E               Gmaj7            D
 In your weakness He is stronger, In your darkness He shines through;
.D                  E7                             G              D
 When you're crying He's your comfort, When you're all alone He's carrying you.

[B1]
.  Bm          D            G                     D
   This valley  is so deep,  I can barely see the sun;
.  Bm        D                G                    B5   A5
   I cry out  for mercy Lord,  And You lift me up again.</lyrics>
