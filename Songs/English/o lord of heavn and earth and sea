<lyrics>[V1]
 O Lord of Heav'n and earth and sea, To Thee all praise and glory be; How shall we show our love to Thee, Who givest all?

[V2]
 The golden sunshine, vernal air, Sweet flow'rs and fruits, Thy love declare; Where harvests ripen, Thou art there, Who givest all.

[V3]
 For peaceful homes and healthful days, For all the blessings earth displays, We owe Thee thankfulness and praise, Who givest all.

[V4]
 Thou didst not spare Thine only Son, But gav'st Him for a world undone, And freely, with that blessèd One, Thou givest all.

[V5]
 Thou giv'st the Spirit's blessèd dow'r, Spirit of life and love and pow'r, And dost His sev'nfold graces show'r Upon us all.

[V6]
 For souls redeemed, for sins forgiv'n,
 For means of grace and hopes of Heav'n,
 Father, all praise to Thee be giv'n,
 Who givest all.

[V7]
 We lose what on ourselves we spend,
 We have as treasure without end
 Whatever, Lord, to Thee we lend,
 Who givest all.

[V8]
 To Thee, from Whom we all derive
 Our life, our gifts, our power to give:
 O may we ever with Thee live,
 Who givest all.</lyrics>
