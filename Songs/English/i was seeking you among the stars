 I was seeking You among the stars,
 Among the colors of flowering fields.
 I was looking for You at the time of thunderstorms
 And the radiance of sunny days.
 I was looking for You but not there!
 You whispered softly from the inside,
 In my heart sounded the soft voice:
 «My dear child, look at the soul!»

[C1]
   &quot;I am with you always, I'm at the heart.
   Call only Me, - I will come in love!&quot;
   &quot;I am with you always, I'm at the heart.
   Call only Me, - I will come in love!&quot;

[V2]
 You were there, my God, always
 Watching me, You waited quietly.
 And when I sought You,
 You showed me the right way.
 I looked for You - and I found,
 You whispered softly from the inside,
 In my heart sounded the soft voice:
 «My dear child, look at the soul!»</lyrics>
