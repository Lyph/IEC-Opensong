<lyrics>[V1]
 On Jordan's bank the Baptist's cry Announces that the Lord is nigh; Come, then, and hearken, for he brings Glad tidings from the King of kings!

[V2]
 Then cleansed be every breast from sin; Make straight the way for God within; Prepare we in our hearts a home, Where such a mighty Guest may come.

[V3]
 For Thou art our Salvation, Lord, Our Refuge, and our great Reward. Without Thy grace our souls must fade And wither like a flow'r decayed.

[V4]
 Stretch forth Thine hand, to heal our sore, And make us rise and fall no more; Once more upon Thy people shine, And fill the world with love divine.

[V5]
 To Him Who left the throne of Heav'n To save mankind, all praise be giv'n; Like praise be to the Father done, And Holy Spirit, Three in One.</lyrics>
