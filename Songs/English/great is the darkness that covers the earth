.  G    C       G   D
 Great is the darkness that covers the Earth,
.     G      C      D
 Oppression, injustice and pain.
.    G    C      G      D
 Nations are slipping in hopeless despair,
.     G     C     D
 Though many have come in Your name.
.     C      G    D
 Watching while sanity dies,
.    C       G      C D
 Touched by the madness and lies.

 Help us bring light to this world

 That we might speed Your return.

[V3]
.  G      C      G    D
 Great celebrations on that final day
.    G    C     D
 When out of the heavens You come.
.    G       C      G     D
 Darkness will vanish, all sorrow will end,
.      G    C     D
 And rulers will bow at Your throne.
.C         G     D
 Our great commission complete,
.     C     G     C   D
 Then face to face we shall meet.</lyrics>
