.        D        A         Bm
 As Your children gather in peace
.        G      A          D
 All the angels sing in Heaven;
.        D      A          Bm
 In Your temple all that I seek
.      G            A       D
 Is to glimpse Your holy presence.

[C1]
.          G                        D
   All the heavens cannot hold You, Lord,
.           G                A
   How much less to dwell in me?
.        G                  Bm
   I can only make my one desire
.  G       A        D
   Holding on to Thee.

[V2]
.        D        A          Bm
 All the angels exalt You on high;
.       G       A      D
 What a kingdom to depart!
.        D         A             Bm
 But You left Your throne in the sky
.        G      A          D
 Just to live inside my heart.

[B1]
.         G                    Bm
   I will always make my one desire
.  G       A        D
   Holding on to Thee.</lyrics>
