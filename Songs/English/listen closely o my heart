<title>Listen Closely, O My Heart</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Listen closely, O my heart
 'Midst the hush of silence
 Not in the wind or the breeze
 Or the fire, or the flood
 Listen closely, O my heart
 'Midst the hush of silence
 Speak, speak to my heart
 With your sweet and soft voice
 Speak, O Word, speak to my heart
 Speak deep down in my heart

[V2]
 Feel, feel, O my heart
 'Midst the sound of silence
 Not in the wind or the breeze
 Or the fire, or the flood
 Feel, feel, O my heart
 'Midst the sound of silence
 Touch, touch, touch my heart
 With your sweet and soft voice
 Touch, O Word, touch my heart
 Touch deep down in my heart

[V3]
 Shine, O my heart, shine
 'Midst the pow'r of silence</lyrics>
