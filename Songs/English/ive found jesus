.        E
 Well, I hear they're singing in the streets
.     A
 That Jesus is alive,
.    E
 And all creation shouts aloud
.      A
 That Jesus is alive.
.      E
 Now surely we can all be changed
.       A
 'Cause Jesus is alive,
.         E
 And everybody here can know
.     A
 That Jesus is alive.

[P1]
.     C#m7                        A
   And I will live for all my days
.                E                    B
   To raise a banner of truth and light,
.     C#m7                        A
   To sing about my Saviour's love
.           E
   And the best thing that happened:
.             B
   It was the day I met You.

[C1]
.              E    A
   I've found Jesus,
.              E    A
   I've found Jesus,
.              E    A
   I've found Jesus,
.              E    A
   I've found Jesus.

[V2]
.        E
 Well, I feel like dancing in the streets
.       A
 'Cause Jesus is alive,
.   E
 To join with all who celebrate
.     A
 That Jesus is alive.
.    E
 The joy of God is in this town
.       A
 'Cause Jesus is alive;
.         E
 For everybody's seen the truth,
.     A
 That Jesus is alive.

[B1]
.            C#m7
   Well, you lifted me from where I was,
.  A
   Set my feet upon a rock.
.  F#m7                             A
   Humbled that you even know about me.
.     C#m7                      A
   Now I have chosen to believe,
.       A
   Believing that you've chosen me;
.  F#m7                           A
   I was lost but now I've found...</lyrics>
