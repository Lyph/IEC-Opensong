<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus, Redeemer,
 Friend and King to me.
 My refuge, my comfort,
 You're everything to me.
 And this heart is on fire for You,
 Yes, this heart is on fire for You.

[V2]
 For You alone are wonderful,
 You alone are Counsellor,
 Everlasting Father, mighty in the heavens.
 Never to forget the love
 You displayed upon a cross.
 Son of God I thank You;
 Prince of Peace, I love Your name.

[V3]
 Saviour, Healer, just and true are You.
 Now reigning in glory,
 Most high and living God.
 And this heart is in awe of You,
 Yes, this heart is in awe of You.</lyrics>
