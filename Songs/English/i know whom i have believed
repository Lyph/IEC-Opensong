<lyrics>[V1]
 I know not why God's wondrous grace To me He hath made known, Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love Redeemed me for His own. But I know Whom I have believèd, And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I've committed Unto Him against that day.

[V2]
 I know not how this saving faith To me He did impart, Nor how believing in His Word Wrought peace within my heart. But I know Whom I have believèd, And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I've committed Unto Him against that day.

[V3]
 I know not how the Spirit moves, Convincing us of sin, Revealing Jesus through the Word, Creating faith in Him. But I know Whom I have believèd, And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I've committed Unto Him against that day.

[V4]
 I know not what of good or ill May be reserved for me, Of weary ways or golden days, Before His face I see. But I know Whom I have believèd, And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I've committed Unto Him against that day.

[V5]
 I know not when my Lord may come, At night or noonday fair, Nor if I walk the vale with Him, Or meet Him in the air. But I know Whom I have believèd, And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I've committed Unto Him against that day.</lyrics>
