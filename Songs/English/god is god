.C#                            Bbm
 And the pain falls like a curtain
.                            F#
 On the things I once called certain.
.                      Bbm                   G#
 And I have to say the words I fear the most:
.              F#
 I just don't know.
.                          Bbm
 And the questions without answers
.                      F#
 Come and paralyze the dancer.
.                       Bbm                  G#
 So I stand here on the stage afraid to move,
.           F#           C#/F
 Afraid to fall. Oh, but fall I must
.        E                           A
 On this truth that my life has been formed from the dust.

[C1]
.  C#                  Bbm
   God is God and I am not.
.         G#        F#          E*           B/D#
   I can only see a part of the picture He's painting.
.  C#                  Bbm
   God is God and I am man,
.          G#         F#
   So I'll never understand it all,
.      E*   B/D#   C#
   For only God is God.

[V2]
 And the sky begins to thunder,
 And I'm filled with awe and wonder,
 'Til the only burning question that remains
 Is who am I?
 Can I form a single mountain?
 Take the stars in hand and count them?
 Can I even take a breath without God giving it to me?
 He is first and last, before all that has been,
 Beyond all that will pass.

[B1]
.          A                           B
   Oh, how great are the riches of His wisdom and knowledge.
.        C#m               A               F#m          D5
   How unsearchable for to Him and through Him and from Him are
.      B5
   all things.
.      C#m              F
   So, let us worship before the throne
.         E                    A
   Of the One who is worthy of worship alone.

[B2]
.  E*   B/D#   C#
   Only God is God.
