 Holy one
 You've always been
 You'll always be the king of kings

[V2]
 Mighty one
 You know all things
 You'll always be the king of kings

[V3]
 You hold it all in Your hand
 You hold it all in Your hand

[V4]
 Worthy one
 You stand alone
 Yours is the throne forever

[V5]
 Jesus Christ
 You are the Lord
 No one can ever take Your place

[V6]
 You hold it all in Your hand
 You hold it all in Your hand

[V7]
 Only You can really make things right
 Surely You will come and split the skies
 Jesus, hear the longing of Your bride
 Let Your kingdom come, come
 Let Your kingdom come, come</lyrics>
