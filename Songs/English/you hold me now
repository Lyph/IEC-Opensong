 VERSE: 1
.         D                       G             D
 On that day when I see all that You have for me
.        Hm                          F#m                A
 When I see You face to face there surrounded by Your grace
.        D                       G                 D
 All my fears swept away in the light of Your embrace
.           Hm                       F#m            A
 Where Your love is all I need and forever I am free

[C1]
   PRE CHORUS: 1
.              Em
   Where the streets are made of gold
.           D/F#
   In Your presence healed and whole
.           G
   Let the songs of heaven rise to You alone

[C2]
   CHORUS:
.  D       G
   No weeping no hurt or pain
.  Hm                G
   No suffering You hold me now You hold me now
.  D         G
   No darkness no sick or lame
.  Hm             G
   No hiding You hold me now You hold me now

[V2]
 VERSE: 2
 In this life I will stand through my joy and my pain
 Knowing there's a greater day there's a hope that never fails
 Where Your Name is lifted high and forever praises rise
 For the glory of Your Name i'm believing for the day

[C3]
   PRE CHORUS: 2
   Where the wars and violence cease
   All creation lives in peace
   Let the songs of heaven Rise to You alone
