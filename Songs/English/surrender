<lyrics>[V1]
.G          G/B    D
 I'm giving You my heart
.             Bm7 C
 And all that is  within
.         D   Em
 I lay it all down
.                D/F#   G
 For the sake of You my King
 I'm giving You my dreams
 Laying down my rights
 I'm giving up my pride
 For the promise of new life

[C1]
   And I surrender
   All to You, all to You
   And I surrender
   All to You, all to You

[V2]
 I'm singing You this song
 Waiting at the cross
 And all the world holds dear
 I count it all as loss
 For the sake of knowing You
 The glory of Your Name
 To know the lasting joy
 Even sharing in Your pain</lyrics>
