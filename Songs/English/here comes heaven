 Children, weep no more
 Hope is on the horizon
 Weary world behold
 Your promised Messiah

[C1]
   Angels, let your song begin
   Here comes Heaven
   Christ is born in Bethlehem
   Here comes Heaven

[V2]
 Sinner, wait no more
 Love has broken the silence
 Come let us adore
 The Savior is with us

[C2]
   Angels, let your song begin
   Here comes Heaven
   Christ is born in Bethlehem
   Here comes Heaven
   Here comes Heaven

[B1]
   Now, behold His glory
   Glory in the highest
   All the earth rejoice for Christ is born
   Now, behold His glory
   Glory in the highest
   All the earth rejoice for Christ is born

[V3]
 Over all who mourn
 Breaks the dawn of salvation
 Darkness reigns no more
 For Jesus is greater
 He is greater

[C3]
   Angels, let your song begin
   Here comes Heaven
   Christ is born in Bethlehem
   Here comes heaven
   Angels, let your song begin
   Here comes Heaven
   All creation worship Him
   Here comes Heaven
   Here comes Heaven</lyrics>
