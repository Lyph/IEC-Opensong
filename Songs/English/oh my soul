<lyrics>[V1]
 Oh my soul
 Oh how you worry, Oh how you weary from fearing
 You lost control
 This was the one thing you didn't see coming
 And no one would blame you, no
 If you cried in private, If you tried to hide it away
 So no one knows
 No one will see if you stop believing

[C1]
   Oh my soul, you are not alone
   There's a place where fear
   Has to face the God you know
   One more day, He will make a way
   Let Him show you how you can lay this down
   'Cause You're not alone

[V2]
 Here and now,
 You can be honest, I won't try to promise
 That someday it all works out
 Cause this is the valley, and even now he is breathing
 On your dry bones
 And there will be dancing
 There will be beauty where beauty was ash and stone
 This much I know

[C2]
   Oh my soul, you are not alone
   There's a place where fear
   Has to face the God you know
   One more day, He will make a way
   Let Him show you how you can lay this down

[B1]
   I'm not strong enough
   I can't take anymore
   (You can lay it down, you can lay it down)
   And my shipwrecked faith will never get me to shore
   (You can lay it down, you can lay it down)
   Can He find me here
   Can He keep me from going under

[C3]
   Oh my soul, you are not alone
   There's a place where fear
   Has to face the God you know
   One more day, He will make a way
   Let Him show you how you can lay this down
   'Cause You're not alone</lyrics>
