.               C2                      G
 You gave light its speed, You are Lord

 Reconciled and free, we are Yours
 What a mystery, what a cost
 You gave it all, Your blood restores and redeems
 You are the Lord, Jesus the King of all Kings

.  C2
    Crown Him with glory
.  G                                     D/F#
    Crown Him with wisdom and with thanks
.  Em
    Crown Him forever
.  C2
    Crown Him with honour
.  G                               D/F#
    Crown Him with power and might</lyrics>
