<lyrics>[V1]
 Rejoice, my heart, be glad and sing, A cheerful trust maintain; For God, the Source of everything, Thy Portion shall remain.

[V2]
 He is thy Treasure, He thy Joy, Thy Life and Light and Lord, Thy Counselor when doubts annoy, Thy Shield and great Reward.

[V3]
 Why spend the day in blank despair, In restless thought the night? On thy Creator cast thy care; He makes thy burdens light.

[V4]
 Did not His love and truth and pow'r Watch o'er thy childhood day? Has He not oft in threat'ning hour Turned dreaded ills away?

[V5]
 His wisdom never plans in vain, Ne'er falters or mistakes; All that His counsels did ordain A happy ending makes.

[V6]
 Upon thy lips, then, lay thy hand
 And trust His guiding love;
 Then like a rock thy peace shall stand
 Here and in heav'n above.

[V7]
 O Lord I sing with lips and heart,
 Joy of my soul, to Thee:
 To Earth Thy knowledge I impart,
 As it is known to me.

[V8]
 Thou art the Fount of grace, I know,
 And Spring so full and free,
 Whence saving health and goodness flow
 Each day so bounteously.

[V9]
 For what have all that live and move
 Through this wide world below
 That does not from Thy bounteous love,
 O Heav'nly Father flow?

[V10]
 Who built the lofty firmament?
 Who spread th'expanse of blue?
 By whom are to our pastures sent
 Refreshing rain and dew?

[V11]
 Who warmeth us in cold and frost?
 Who shields us from the wind?
 Who orders it that oil and must
 We in their season find?

[V12]
 Who is it life and health bestows?
 Who keeps us with His hand
 In golden peace, wards off war's woes
 From our dear native land?

[V13]
 O Lord of this and all our store
 Thou art the author blest;
 Thou keepest watch before our door,
 While we securely rest.

[V14]
 Thou feedest us from year to year,
 And constant dost abide;
 With ready help in time of fear,
 Thou standest at our side.

[V15]
 He ever will with patience chide,
 His rod falls gently down,
 And all thy sins He casts aside
 And in the sea doth drown.

[V16]
 When silent woe thy bosom rends,
 His pity sees thy grief,
 Supplies what to His glory tends
 And to thine own relief.

[V17]
 He knows how oft a Christian weeps
 And why his tears now fall;
 And in the book His mercy keeps
 These things are noted all.

[V18]
 Our deepest needs dost Thou supply,
 Thou giv'st what lasts for aye.
 Thou lead'st us to our home on high,
 When hence we pass away.</lyrics>
