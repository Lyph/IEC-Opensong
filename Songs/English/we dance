 You steady me
 Slow and sweet, we sway
 Take the lead and I will follow
 Finally ready now
 To close my eyes and just believe
 That You won't lead me
 Where You don't go

[V2]
 When my faith gets tired
 And my hope seems lost
 You spin me round and round
 And remind me of that song
 The one You wrote for me
 And we dance

[V3]
 And I've been told
 To pick up my sword
 And fight for love
 Little did I know
 That Love had won for me
 Here in Your arms

[V4]
 You still my heart again
 And I breathe You in
 Like I've never breathed 'till now

[V5]
 When my faith gets tired
 And my hope seems lost
 You spin me round and round
 And remind me of that song
 The one You wrote for me
 And we dance
 And I will lock eyes
 With the One who's ransomed me
 The One who gave me joy for mourning
 And I will lock eyes
 With the One who's chosen me
 The One who set my feet to dancing?

[V6]
 We dance
 Just You and me
 It's nice to know I'm not alone
 I found my home here in Your arms
 It's nice to know I'm not alone?
 I found my home here in Your arms
 It's nice to know I'm not alone
 I found my home here in Your arms</lyrics>
