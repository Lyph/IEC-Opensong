.G                            D7
 Jesus bids us shine with a clear, pure light,
.D7              G
 Like a little candle burning in the night;
.G                         C         G
 In this world of darkness, we must shine,
.G                        C  D7   G
 You in your small corner and I in mine.

[V2]
 Jesus bids us shine, then, for all around
 Many kinds of darkness in this world abound
 Sin and want and sorrow; we must shine,
 You in your small corner, and I in mine.</lyrics>
