<lyrics>[V1]
 Come, come to the water
 All who are thirsty
 Come and be filled
 Come, come to the river
 Brothers and sisters
 Come and be healed
 Come and be healed

[C1]
   We believe in the kingdom come
   We believe in the risen Son
   You bring our hearts to life
   Lord we come with our hands up high
   We believe You will satisfy
   You bring our hearts to life
   You bring our hearts to life
   We are alive

[V2]
 See people returning
 The love of the father drawing us in
 See salvation coming
 Jesus our Savior, light of the world
 Light of the world

[B1]
   Let revival come
   Let the people sing
   The glory of Your name

[B2]
   Let revival come
   Let the people sing
   The glory of Your name</lyrics>
