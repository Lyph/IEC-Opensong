 I can feel You, flowing through me
 Holy Spirit come andfill me up
 Come andfill me up
 Love and mercy fill my senses
 I am thirsty for Your presence Lord
 Come andfill me up

[C1]
   Lord let Your mercy wash away all of my sins
   Fill me completely with Your love once again
   I need You, I want You
   I love Your presence
   I need You, I want You
   I love Your presence
   Come and fill me up</lyrics>
