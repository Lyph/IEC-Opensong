<lyrics>[V1]
 Go to dark Gethsemane, ye that feel the tempter's pow'r; Your Redeemer's conflict see, watch with Him one bitter hour, Turn not from His griefs away; learn from Jesus Christ to pray.

[V2]
 Follow to the judgment hall, view the Lord of Life arraigned; O the wormwood and the gall! O the pangs His soul sustained! Shun not suff'ring, shame, or loss; learn from Christ to bear the cross.

[V3]
 Calv'ry's mournful mountain climb; there, adoring at His feet, Mark that miracle of time, God's own sacrifice complete. &quot;It is finished!&quot; hear Him cry; learn from Jesus Christ to die.

[V4]
 Early hasten to the tomb where they laid His breathless clay; All is solitude and gloom. Who has taken Him away? Christ is ris'n! He meets our eyes; Savior, teach us so to rise.</lyrics>
