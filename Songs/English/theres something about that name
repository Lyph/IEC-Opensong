<lyrics>[V1]
.D             Dm7 D7
 Jesus, Jesus, Je__sus:
.             G          Gm        D
 There's just something about that Name;
.D                Dm7 D7
 Master, Saviour, Je__sus:
.         E7                  Em7  A7
 Like the fragrance after the rain;

[V2]
.D             Dm7 D7
 Jesus, Jesus, Je__sus:
.        G                   F#sus F#7
 Let all heaven and earth proclaim;
.B         B7             E7
 Kings and kingdoms shall all pass away,
.            Em7        A7        D
 But there's something about that Name.</lyrics>
