.Em
 I see the moon, a million stars are out tonight
.                 D      A
 Gentle reminders of the way You are
.Em
 A sea of glass, a raging storm has come to pass
.                      D    A
 You show Your face in an array of ways

[V2]
.Em
 I know You're there, I feel Your love through my despair
.                         D     A
 You speak the words that ease away the pain
.Em
 My heart is free, my eyes are clear, my soul is healed
.                  D     A
 Now that You have got a hold on me

[P1]
.  Cmaj7                      A/C#
   My feet may venture to the ground
.                            G/D
   But You will never let me down
.                         B/D#
   I can't hold it in, my soul is screaming!

[C1]
.  Em  C    G/D      D
   Hey you, I'm into Jesus
.  Em  C    G/D      D         Em
   Hey you, I'm into Jesus, oh yeah
.  Em  C    G/D      D
   Hey you, I'm into Jesus
.      Am                 Bm
   Hey you, I've seen the truth
.          Em
   And I believe

[C2]
.          E    GA
   And I believe

[B1]
.  E G     A
   I still believe (2x)
.  E             G
   Hey you, this kid is back
.        A
   And I do declare that the Son is shining
.  E            G
   Hey you, the kid is back
.         F#m                 A
   With a red alert 'cause it might be blinding
.  E            G
   Hey you, the kid is back
.        A
   And I do declare that the Son is shining
.  E            G          F#mA
   Hey you, the kid is back
.  C                          A/C#
   My feet may venture to the ground...</lyrics>
