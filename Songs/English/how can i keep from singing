<lyrics>[V1]
 There is an endless song,
 Echoes in my soul;
 I hear the music ring.
 And though the storms may come,
 I am holding on;
 To the Rock I cling.

[C1]
   How can I keep from singing Your praise?
   How can I ever say enough?
   How amazing is Your Love!
   How can I keep from shouting Your Name?
   I know I am loved by the King
   And it makes my heart want to sing!

[V2]
 I will lift my eyes
 In the darkest night,
 For I know my Savior lives.
 And I will walk with You,
 Knowing You'll see me through,
 And sing the songs You give.

[B1]
   I can sing in the troubled times,
   Sing when I win.
   I can sing when I lose my step
   And fall down again.
   I can sing, 'cause You pick me up,
   Sing, 'cause You're there.
   I can sing, 'cause You hear me, Lord,
   When I call to You in prayer.
   I can sing with my last breath,
   Sing, for I know
   That I'll sing with the angels
   And the saints around the throne!

[C2]
   How can I keep from singing Your praise?
   How can I ever say enough?
   How amazing is Your Love!
   How can I keep from shouting Your Name?
   I know I am loved by the King,

[B2]
   And it makes my heart...
   I am loved by the King,
   And it makes my heart...
   I am loved by the King,
   And it makes my heart want to sing!
   Yeah, I can sing!</lyrics>
