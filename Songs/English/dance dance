.D       G            D            A
 Lord, I cried out, I cried out to You.
.    D        G          D     A
 You answered me in Your mercy.
.     D         G
 Your anger was fleeting,
.    D          A             D        G    D   AD
 And now I will dance in your favor all my life.

[C1]
.     D         G
   Let my heart sing for you
.      D            A
   And not...remain silent.
.      D           G
   Let my heart sing for you.
.          D       A      D     AD
   Turn my weeping into a dance.

[B1]
.     Bm*             G/B*
   So dance, dance my soul;
.             D*                A/C#*
   There's no reason for you to weep.
.     Bm*             G/B*
   So dance, dance my soul;
.       D*            A/C#* G/B*
   Make music to your King.</lyrics>
