<lyrics>[V1]
 Higher than the mountains that I face
 Stronger than the power of the grave
 Constant in the trial and the change
 One thing... Remains (repeat)

[V2]
 Your love never fails, never gives up
 Never runs out on me (3x)

[V3]
 On and on and on and on it goes

[V4]
 It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
 And I never, ever, have to be afraid
 One thing remains

[B1]
   Bridge:
   In death, In life, I'm confident and
   covered by the power of Your great love
   My debt is paid, there's nothing that can
   separate my heart from Your great love</lyrics>
