<lyrics>[V1]
 Lo! He comes with clouds descending, Once for ev'ry sinner slain; Thousand thousand saints attending, Swell the triumph of His train: Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! God appears on earth to reign.

[V2]
 Ev'ry eye shall now behold Him Robed in dreadful majesty; Those who set at naught and sold Him, Pierced and nailed Him to the tree, Deeply wailing, deeply wailing, deeply wailing, Shall the true Messiah see.

[V3]
 Ev'ry island, sea, and mountain, Heav'n and earth, shall flee away; All who hate Him must, confounded, Hear the trump proclaim the day: Come to judgment! Come to judgment! Come to judgment! Come to judgment! Come away!

[V4]
 Now redemption, long expected, See in solemn pomp appear; All His saints, by man rejected, Now shall meet Him in the air: Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! See the day of God appear!

[V5]
 Answer Thine own bride and Spirit, Hasten, Lord, the gen'ral doom! The new Heav'n and earth inherit, Take Thy pining exiles home: All creation, all creation, all creation, Travails! groans! and bids Thee come!

[V6]
 The dear tokens of His passion Still His dazzling body bears;
 Cause of endless exultation To His ransomed worshipers;
 With what rapture, with what rapture, with what rapture
 Gaze we on those glorious scars!

[V7]
 Yea, Amen! let all adore Thee, High on Thine eternal throne;
 Savior, take the power and glory, Claim the kingdom for Thine own;
 O come quickly! O come quickly! O come quickly!
 Everlasting God, come down!</lyrics>
