 One day when heaven was filled with His praises,
 One day when sin was as black as could be,
 Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin-
 Dwelt among men, my example is He!

[C1]
   Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;
   Buried, He carried my sins far away;
   Rising, He justified freely forever:
   One day He's coming-O glorious day!

[V2]
 One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain,
 One day they nailed Him to die on the tree;
 Suffering anguish, despised and rejected;
 Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He.

[V3]
 One day they left Him alone in the garden,
 One day He rested, from suffering free;
 Angels came down o'er His tomb to keep vigil;
 Hope of the hopeless, my Savior is He.

[V4]
 One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,
 One day the stone rolled away from the door;
 Then He arose, over death He had conquered;
 Now is ascended, my Lord evermore.

[V5]
 One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,
 One day the skies with His glory will shine;
 Wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing;
 Glorious Savior, this Jesus is mine!</lyrics>
