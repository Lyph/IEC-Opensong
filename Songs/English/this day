<lyrics>[V1]
.C            Am
 It's 6 A.M.; I'm so tired.
.Em                  F       G
 The alarm sounds; a new day begins.
.C           Am
 Before I go and disturb this peaceful moment,
.Em         G
 I look to You.

[C1]
.  C               F
   I want to say a prayer
.  G         C                Am
   Before my feet can hit the ground.
.               F           G
   Lord, I give this day to You.

[V2]
.C          Am
 I'm amazed how you forgive me.
.Em                 F   G
 Yesterday seems so far behind.
.C                         Am
 It's a brand new day, and every day's a new beginning.
.Em        G
 I look to You.

[B1]
.  C
   Breathe in. (I breathe in)
.  Am
   Breathe out. (I breathe out)
.          G      C         Am    G
   Breathe in and watch the day begin.
.  G
   I wanna watch the day begin.

[B2]
.    F                C
   I give this day to you.</lyrics>
