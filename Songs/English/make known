<lyrics>[V1]
 Make known the riches of Your glory
 Make known the power of Your grace
 Use me to show the world Your greatness
 Send me to demonstrate Your love

[V2]
 Nothing can separate me from unfailing love
 Nothing can ever take me from Your faithful arms,
 And here I rejoice, in You, I rejoice

[V3]
 Jesus, hung dying and rejected
 Such love displayed for all to see
 And O, it makes me bow in wonder
 To know You conquered death for me, for me

[V4]
 You work all things for my good
 And for Your glory, for Your glory</lyrics>
