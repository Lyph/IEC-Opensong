<title>Here I Bow</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 [Verse 1]
 Where would I run
 But to the throne of mercy
 Where would I kneel
 But at this cross of grace
 How great the love
 How strong the hand that holds us
 Beautiful, so beautiful

[V2]
 [Chorus]
 So here, I bow, to lift You high
 Jesus, be glorified
 In all things, for all my life
 I am Yours, forever Yours

[V3]
 [Verse 2]
 There is a King
 Who bore the scars of healing
 There is a Son
 Who came in grace and truth
 How great the love
 That carries us to kindness
 Wonderful, You're wonderful

[V4]
 [Chorus]
 So here, I bow, to lift You high
 Jesus, be glorified
 In all things, for all my life
 I am Yours, forever Yours

[V5]
 [Bridge]
 God here, and now, be lifted high
 Right here, and now, be glorified
 God of heaven and earth
 God who brought me back to life
 I am Yours, forever Yours
 God here, and now, be lifted high
 Right here, and now, be glorified
 God of heaven and earth
 God who brought me back to life
 I am Yours, forever Yours

[V6]
 [Chorus]
 So here, I bow, to lift You high
 Jesus, be glorified
 In all things, for all my life
 I am Yours, forever Yours

[V7]
 [Outro]
 So here, I bow, to lift You high
 Jesus, be glorified
 In all things, and for all my life
 I am Yours, forever Yours ...</lyrics>
