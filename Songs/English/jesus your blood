 Pierced for my transgressions
 Wounded for my sins
 This man of sorrows came to take my place

[V2]
 King over creation
 Slain for my salvation
 Unspeakable love, abounding grace

[V3]
 Now I am coming to this holy place
 I am drawing near to seek Your face

[V4]
 Jesus, Your blood has made my hands clean
 So I will not hide my face from You

[V5]
 You have won the victory
 You have paid the cost
 While I was still in sin You died for me

[V6]
 Carrying my sorrows
 Lifting off my shame
 Bearing all my sin to set me free

[V7]
 I will ascend the hill of the Lord
 'Cause You have rescued me</lyrics>
