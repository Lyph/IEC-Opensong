 VERSE 01

[V2]
 THERE'S A POWER THAT'S MADE PERFECT IN MY WEAKNESS
 FILLS ME UP WITH A STRENGTH THAT IS FEARLESS
 I FIND HOPE WITHIN YOUR EVERLASTING PROMISE
 IT FANS MY FAITH INTO FLAME

[V3]
 CHORUS

[V4]
 I'M LIVING WITH A FIRE BURNING INSIDE OF ME
 I'M LIVING FOR THE SAVIOUR JESUS ETERNALLY
 WITH ALL THAT I AM LORD I GIVE YOU MY HEART
 LET THE FLAME SHINE BRIGHTER. LET YOUR PRAISE SING LOUDER.

[V5]
 VERSE 02

[V6]
 IN A MOMENT YOU TURN MOURNING INTO DANCING
 WHEN I PRAISE I CAN FEEL THE DARKNESS TREMBLING
 ALL MY FEAR IS SWEPT AWAY BY PERFECT LOVE
 YOU FAN MY FAITH INTO FLAME

[V7]
 BRIDGE

[V8]
 NO DARKNESS CAN STAND AGAINST THIS BRIGHTER GLORY
 HIS PROMISE IS SURE JESUS DECIDES MY STORY</lyrics>
