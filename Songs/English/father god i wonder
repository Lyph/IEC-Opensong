. Em
 Father God, I wonder
.       D
 How I managed to exist
.          C
 Without the knowledge of Your parenthood
. D        B7
 And Your loving care.

[V2]
.      Em
 But now I am Your child,
.      D
 I am adopted in Your family,
.     C
 And I can never be alone,
.      D       B7
 Cause Father God, You're there beside me.

[C1]
.   Em    Am       D   G
   I will sing Your praises, I will sing Your praises,
.   Em    Am          D     B7
   I will sing Your praises,  forevermore. (2X)</lyrics>
