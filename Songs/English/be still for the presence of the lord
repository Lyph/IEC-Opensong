.D                F#m             Bm
 Be still for the presence of the Lord
.    Em7         A
 The Holy One is here
.D        F#m        Bm
 Come bow before Him now

 With reverence and fear
.G  A      D
 In Him no sin is found
.G  A        D
 We stand on holy ground
.G  A             F#m             Bm
 Be still for the presence of the Lord

[V2]
 Be still for the glory of the Lord
 Is shining all around
 He burns with holy fire
 With splendour He is crowned
 How awesome is the sight
 Our radiant King of light
 Be still for the glory of the Lord
 Is shining all around

[V3]
 Be still for the power of the Lord
 Is moving in this place
 He comes to cleanse and heal
 To minister His grace
 No work too hard for Him
 In faith receive from Him
 Be still for the power of the Lord
 Is moving in this place</lyrics>
