 [Verse 1]
 I fall down upon the ground
 Press my face against the earth
 Till my heart it rises over my head
 As the wheat it bows down low
 When the autumn wind blows
 I kneel before the One
 I love

[V2]
 [Chorus]
 Find me grateful
 Find me thankful
 Find me on my knees
 Find me dreaming
 Find me singing
 Find me lost in Your grace

[V3]
 [Verse 2]
 Like the dust that You first held
 In a garden where You knelt
 Pull me up against Your face again
 Till the breath of Your hope
 Fill the depths of my soul
 Till all I know is I've been
 Found by love

[V4]
 [Chorus]
 Find me grateful
 Find me thankful
 Find me on my knees
 Find me dreaming
 Find me singing
 Find me lost in Your grace

[V5]
 [Verse 2]
 Like the dust that You first held
 In a garden where You knelt
 Pull me up against Your face again
 Till the breath of Your hope
 Fill the depths of my soul
 Till all I know is I've been
 Found by love

[V6]
 [Chorus]
 Find me grateful
 Find me thankful
 Find me on my knees
 Find me dreaming
 Find me singing
 Find me lost in Your grace
 Find me grateful
 Find me thankful
 Find me on my knees
 Find me dreaming
 Find me singing
 Find me lost in Your grace

[V7]
 [Outro]
 Find me grateful
 Find me thankful
 Find me on my knees
 Find me dreaming
 Find me singing
 Find me lost in Your grace...</lyrics>
