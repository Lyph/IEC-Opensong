<lyrics>[V1]
.F      Am      Gsus     F
 Angels we have heard on high,
.C       F       F/C  C   F
 Sweetly singing o'er the plains,
.F       Am        Dm7  F
 And the mountains in reply,
.C   F         F/C  C   F
 Echoing their joy__ous strains.

[V2]
.F          Am       Gsus  F
 Shepherds, why this jubi__lee?
.C        F      F/C     C  F
 Why your joyous strains prolong?
.F        Am       Dm7     F
 What the gladsome tidings be
.C       F          F/C   C  F
 Which inspire your heavenly song?

[V3]
.F       Am    Gsus    F
 Come to Bethlehem and see
.C         F         F/C C    F
 Him whose birth the an__gels sing.
.F     Am      Dm7    F
 Come adore on bended knee
.C           F         F/C  C    F
 Christ, the Lord, the new__born King.
