.F#m7                                 D   Bm
 The world's shaking with the love of God.
.F#m7                                    D   Bm
 Great and glorious, let the whole earth sing.

[P1]
.      D
   And all you ever do
.     A/C#
   is change the old for new;
.  Bsus
   People we believe that...

[C1]
.  A             E/G#
   God is bigger than
.            F#m7
   the air I breathe,
.                  E
   The world we'll leave.
.  A                 E/G#
   God will save the day,
.               F#m7
   and all will say,
.          E   (F#m7Bm7C#m7toverse)
   My Glorious!

[V2]
 Clouds are breaking, heaven's come to earth.
 Hearts awakening, let the church bells ring.

[B1]
.          D            E
   My Glorious! My Glorious!
.          D            E
   My Glorious! My Glorious!

[B2]
.  D             E
   Glory, glory, send Your glory.
.  D             E
   Glory, glory, send Your glory.</lyrics>
