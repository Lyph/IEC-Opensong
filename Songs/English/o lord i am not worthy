<lyrics>[V1]
 O Lord, I am not worthy That Thou should'st come to me, But speak the words of comfort, My spirit healed shall be.

[V2]
 O Lord, Thou art all holy, The angels Thee adore; How, then, ought I sincerely My wrongs and sins deplore!

[V3]
 But when Thou soon wilt enter My heart, my sinful heart, Then heal me, be my shelter, For Thou my Savior art.

[V4]
 O Lord, how can I thank Thee For such a gift as this? A gift which truly filleth My soul with heav'nly bliss!

[V5]
 I praise Thee, I extol Thee, I love Thee O my Sire, Till once in joy and glory, In heav'n I Thee admire.</lyrics>
