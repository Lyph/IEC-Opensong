.    Esus4             E
 One thing my heart is set upon,
.    Esus4              E
 One thing that I would ask:
.   Esus4              E
 To know you, Lord, as close as one
.      Esus4           E
 Could hope to on this earth.

[C1]
.  E/A   B            E/A  B
   Intimacy, O Jesus, Intimacy.
.     E/A           B                 E/A   B
   My treasure will be, O Jesus, Your intimacy.

[V2]
 To look upon Your beauty, Lord,
 Your glory and Your heart;
 To know You close and closer still
 Each day upon this earth

[V3]
 Lord, since the day I saw You first,
 My soul was satisfied;
 And yet because I see in part,
 I'm searching more to find.</lyrics>
