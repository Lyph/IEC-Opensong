<lyrics>[V1]
 Moon and stars
 Telling us of who You are
 You light the way and move our hearts
 From across the universe

[V2]
 Day and night
 The song we bring is Your delight
 You listen close to every cry
 You hang on every word

[C1]
   All across the universe
   We can feel Your love on earth
   All across the universe
   Your love revealed Your love is real

[V3]
 Infinite
 No limit to the love You give
 Pouring out and reaching in
 Pleasing like the sun like the sun

[V4]
 Ohh, ohh
 Your love revealed Your love is real
 Ohh, ohh
 Your love revealed Your love is real

[V5]
 Moon and stars
 Telling us of who You are</lyrics>
