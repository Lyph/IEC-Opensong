<lyrics>[V1]
 [Verse]
 Surely You are good
 But my heart ran away
 Surely You are good
 But I was swept away

[V2]
 [Bridge]
 But You me brought back to this place
 You gave me water
 You gave me drink

[V3]
 [Chorus]
 My flesh and my heart may fail
 Whom have I but You
 You have been my strength, my refuge
 Whom have I but You

[V4]
 [Refrain]
 The nearness of You is my only good [x4]

[V5]
 [Chorus 2]
 My flesh and my heart may fail
 Whom have I but You
 You have been my strength, my refuge
 Whom have I but You
 There is no one else
 Whom have I but You
 There is no one else
 Whom have I but You</lyrics>
