.E           Asus2 C#9      B9
 Am I at the point  of no improvement?
.E           Asus2   C#9         B9
 What of the death I still dwell in?
.E        Asus2        C#9     B9
 I try to excel, but I feel no movement.
.E        Asus2        C#9          B9
 Can I be free of this unreleasable sin?

[C1]
.  E     Asus2  C#9         B9
   Never under__estimate my Jesus.
.  E                      Asus2
   You're telling me that there's no hope.
.      C#9                B9
   I'm telling you you're wrong.
.  E     Asus2  C#9         B9
   Never under__estimate my Jesus.
.  E                Asus2              C#9            B9
   When the world around you crumbles, He will be strong.
   He will be strong.

.E             Asus2 C#9              B9
 I throw up my hands. &quot;Oh, the impossibilities.&quot;
.E              Asus2           C#9       B9
 Frustrated and tired, where do I go from here?
.E                 Asus2              C#9          B9
 Now I'm searching for the confidence I've lost so willingly.
.E                Asus2    C#9               B9
 Overcoming these obstacles is overcoming my fear.

[B1]
.  E                 Asus2
    I think I can't;  I think I can't,
.  C#9             C9
   But I think You can; I think You can.
.  E                 Asus2
    I think I can't;  I think I can't,
.  C#9             C9
   But I think You can; I think You can
.  F#9                 Asus2                       E
   Gather my insuficiencies and place them in Your hands,
.  Asus2              C#9
   Place them in Your hands.
.  B9
   Place them in Your hands.</lyrics>
