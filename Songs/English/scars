 VERSE 1

[V2]
.A                               C#m
 You cleared my stains with the tides of grace
.            E
 That wash over me
.            B/D#
 That wash over me
.     A                        C#m
 Took upon Yourself all the guilt and shame
.         E
 Hung it on the cross
.         F#m
 Hung it on the cross

[V3]
 VERSE 2
.        A                    C#m
 You defeated death, stood above the grave
.              E
 You broke every chain
.           B/D#
 You broke every chain
.      A                  C#m
 You rose again with the keys of life
.           E
 To the highest place
.              F#m
 You're the highest name

[V4]
 PRECHORUS
.       A         C#m
 Only love this true
.           E                B/D#
 Would give all to breakthrough
.        A              C#m
 I rise up, I stand strong
.          E          F#m
 In Your name we have won

[V5]
 CHORUS
.                       A   C#m
 You love me with Your scars
.                       E   B/D#
 You love me with Your scars
.                        A  C#m
 You love me with Your scars
.                       E   F#m
 You love me with Your scars</lyrics>
