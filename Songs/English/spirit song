 Oh let the Son of God enfold you
 With His Spirit and His love
 Let Him fill your heart
 And satisfy your soul
 Oh let Him have those things
 That hold you
 And His Spirit like a dove
 Will descend upon your life
 And make you whole

[C1]
   Jesus oh Jesus
   Come and fill Your lambs
   Jesus oh Jesus
   Come and fill Your lambs

[V2]
 Oh come and sing this song
 With gladness as your hearts
 Are filled with joy
 Lift your hands in sweet surrender
 To His name
 Oh give Him all your tears and sadness
 Give Him all your years of pain
 And you'll enter into life in Jesus' name</lyrics>
