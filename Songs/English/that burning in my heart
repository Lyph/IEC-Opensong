 That burning in my heart
 That loud cry of my heart
 That awak'ning in my soul
 Is to you
 To you, O Lord
 That awak'ning in my soul
 Is to you
 To you, O Lord, to you

[V2]
 I am in your presence
 Hands clasped and waiting for you
 Many prayers are on my tongue
 They're to you
 To you, O Lord
 Many prayers are on my tongue
 They're to you
 To you, O Lord, to you

[V3]
 My hands uplifted to you
 My spirit lifted high
 My knees are bent in prayer
 To you
 In prayer to you
 My knees are bent in prayer
 To you
 In prayer to you, to you</lyrics>
