.Em G D C
 I gave You my heart
 In exchange for a brand new start.
 Lord, then You made me clean
 And You set me apart.

[V2]
.Em G D C
 You see, I was in the dark,
 But You're the Bright and Morning Star.
 Now with Your amazing grace,
 You keep a smile upon my face.

[C1]
.  C G D Em
   Because...
   When the son die, He didn't die forever.
   Put Him in a tomb and three days later.
   Died on a cross and rose again.
   Dip me in His blood and washed away my sins,
   sins, sins, eh eh eh.
   Thank the Lord I'm born again,
   ain, ain, hey, hey, hey, hey.</lyrics>
