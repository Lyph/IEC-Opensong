<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus came, the heav'ns adoring, Came with peace from realms on high; Jesus came for man's redemption, Lowly came on earth to die. Alleluia! Alleluia! Came in deep humility.

[V2]
 Jesus comes again in mercy, When our hearts are bowed with care; Jesus comes again in answer To an earnest, heartfelt prayer; Alleluia! Alleluia! Comes to save us from despair.

[V3]
 Jesus comes to hearts rejoicing, Bringing news of sins forgiv'n; Jesus comes in sounds of gladness, Leading souls redeemed to Heav'n; Alleluia! Alleluia! Now the gate of death is riv'n.

[V4]
 Jesus comes in joy and sorrow, Shares alike our hopes and fears; Jesus comes, whate'er befalls us, Glads our hearts, and dries our tears; Alleluia! Alleluia! Cheering e'en our failing years.

[V5]
 Jesus comes on clouds triumphant, When the heav'ns shall pass away; Jesus comes again in glory; Let us then our homage pay, Alleluia! Alleluia! Till the dawn of endless day.</lyrics>
