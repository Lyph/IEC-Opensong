 I wanna be close close to your side
 Heaven is real and death is a lie
 I wanna hear voices of angels above
 Singing as one

[C1]
   Hallelujah Holy Holy
   God almighty Great I am
   Who is worthy
   None beside Thee
   God Almighty
   Great I Am

[V2]
 I wanna be near near to your heart
 Loving the world hating the dark
 I want to see dry bones living again
 Singing as one

[B1]
   The mountains shake before Him
   The demons run and flee
   At the mention of the name
   King of Majesty
   There is no power in hell
   Or any who can stand
   Before the power and the presence of the Great I am
   The Great I am The Great I am
   The Great I am The Great I am The Great I am</lyrics>
