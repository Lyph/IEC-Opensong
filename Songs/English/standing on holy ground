<lyrics>[V1]
 Standing on holy ground
 Mercy and grace I've found
 I'm here before Your throne now
 By a new and living way

[V2]
 Jesus I come to You
 I lift up my eyes to You
 How You've comforted me
 And I long to see Your face

[V3]
 Your are my strength, my song
 You are my shield, my redeemer
 You are my hope, my salvation, and my God
 I'll always bring my praise to You O God

[V4]
 So I will sing to You,
 Beautiful things You have done
 Great is Your name in Zion, Holy One
 I'll always bring my praise to You
 I'll always bring my praise to You
 I'll always bring my praise to You, O God</lyrics>
