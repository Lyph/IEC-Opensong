 See His love nailed onto a cross
 Perfect and blameless life
 given as sacrifice
 See Him there all in the name of love
 Broken yet glorious,
 all for the sake of us

[C1]
   This is Jesus in His glory
   King of Heaven dying for me
   It is finished, He has done it
   Death is beaten, Heaven beckons me

[V2]
 Greater love no one could ever show
 Mercy so undeserved,
 freedom I should not know
 All my sin, all of my hidden shame
 Died with Him on the cross,
 eternity won for us

[B1]
   // Such love, such love
   Such love is this for me  //</lyrics>
