 I tasted the world, seen more than enough
 Its promises fleeting
 Of water and wine I emptied the cup
 And found myself wanting

[P1]
   But there is a well that never runs dry
   The water of life the blood of the Vine

[C1]
   All I know is Everything I have means nothing
   Jesus if You're not my one thing
   Everything I need right now
   All I need is You right now

[V2]
 Just one thing I ask and this I will seek
 If only to know You
 To be where You are and go where You lead
 My God I will follow

[P2]
   The things of this world I've counted as loss
   I lay it all down to take up this cross

[C2]
   All I know is Everything I have means nothing
   Jesus if You're not my one thing
   Everything I need right now
   All I want is Everything You are and nothing
   Jesus if You're not my one thing
   Everything to me right now

[B1]
   Whoa, whoa
   I want nothing but to know You
   And to be with You my God
   And I'll sing
   Whoa, whoa
   And with everything within me
   I will worship You my God</lyrics>
