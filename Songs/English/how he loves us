<lyrics>[V1]
.F#
 He is jealous for me
.D#m7
 Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree
.C#                     H
 Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy

[V2]
.F#
 When all of a sudden, I am unaware of these
.D#m7
 Afflictions eclipsed by glory
.  C#
 And I realize just how beautiful You are
.    H
 And how great your affections are for me.

[P1]
.    F#         D#m7
   And oh, how He loves us so
.        C#
   Oh, how He loves us
.          H
   How He loves us so.

[V3]
.F#
 He is jealous for me
.D#m7
 Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree
.C#                     H
 Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy

[V4]
.F#
 When all of a sudden, I am unaware of these
.D#m7
 Afflictions eclipsed by glory
.  C#
 And I realize just how beautiful You are
.    H
 And how great your affections are for me.

[V5]
.  F#         D#m7
 And oh, how He loves us so
.      C#
 Oh, how He loves us
.        H
 How He loves us so.

[C1]
.      F#
   Yeah, He loves us
.        D#m7
   Woah, how He loves us
.        C#
   Woah, how He loves us
.        H
   Woah, how He loves.

[V6]
.F#
 We are His portion and He is our prize,
.D#m7
 Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes
.C#                  H
 If grace is an ocean we're all sinking ha ha

[V7]
. F#
 So heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss
.   D#m7
 And my heart turns violently inside of my chest
.  C#
 I don't have time to maintain these regrets
.  H
 When I think about the way</lyrics>
