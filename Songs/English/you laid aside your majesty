<lyrics>[V1]
 You laid aside Your majesty
 Gave up everything for me
 Suffered at the hands
 Of those You had created
 You took all my guilt and shame
 When You died and rose again
 Now today You reign
 In heaven and earth exalted

[C1]
   I really want to worship You, my Lord
   You have won my heart, and I am Yours
   For ever and ever I will love You
   You are the only one who died for me
   Gave Your life to set me free
   So I lift my voice to You in adoration</lyrics>
