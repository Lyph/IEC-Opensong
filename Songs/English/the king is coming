<title>The King Is Coming</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 The marketplace is empty,
 No more traffic in the streets,
 All the builders' tools are silent,
 No more time to harvest wheat,
 Busy housewives cease their labors,
 In the courtroom no debate,
 Work on earth is all suspended
 As the King comes thro' the gate.

[C1]
   O the King is coming,
   The King is coming!
   I just heard the trumpets sounding,
   And now His face I see,
   O the King is coming,
   The King is coming!
   Praise God, He's coming for me!

[V2]
 Happy faces line the hallways,
 Those whose lives have been redeemed,
 Broken homes that He has mended,
 Those from prison He has freed,
 Little children and the aged
 Hand in hand stand all aglow,
 Who were crippled, broken, ruined,
 Clad in garments white as snow.

[V3]
 I can hear the chariots rumble,
 I can see the marching throng,
 The flurry of God's trumpets
 Spells the end of sin and wrong:
 Regal robes are now unfolding,
 Heaven's grandstand's all in place,
 Heaven's choir now assembled,
 Start to sing &quot;Amazing Grace!&quot;</lyrics>
