<lyrics>[V1]
 Holy Holy Holy is the God of Israel
 Elders bow in worship as the angel voices swell
 Fragrant clouds of incense swirl around Your throne of grace
 Lord we bow in worship at the brilliance of Your face. We cry

[C1]
   Holy Holy Holy is the Lord
   Holy Holy Holy is the Lord

[V2]
 Holy Holy Holy is the song that Heaven sings
 All creation praise Him Hallelujah Elohim
 Come to reign forever King of kings and Lord of lords
 Lift your head O Zion open wide you ancient doors And cry</lyrics>
