<lyrics>[V1]
 God, that madest earth and Heaven, darkness and light; Who the day for toil hast given, for rest the night; May Thine angel guards defend us, Slumber sweet Thy mercy send us; Holy dreams and hopes attend us, all through the night.

[V2]
 And when morn again shall call us, to run life's way, May we still, whate'er befall us, Thy will obey. From the pow'r of evil hide us, In the narrow pathway guide us, Nor Thy smile be e'er denied us all through the day.

[V3]
 Guard us waking, guard us sleeping, and when we die, May we in Thy mighty keeping all peaceful lie; When the last dread call shall wake us, Do not Thou, our God, forsake us, But to reign in glory take us with Thee on high.</lyrics>
