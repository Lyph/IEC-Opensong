 There's a voice in the silence,
 Piercing the darkness of my own selfish soul
 There's a cry deep within me, a yearning to feel you
 I look to you, Lord

[P1]
   I can pretend I don't run from the feelings
   I'm trying to hide
   Must get the focus of me and my problems
   I look to the cross

[V2]
 You are my Rock jn You I stand
 Safe from the storms that surround me
 You're my only Rock, In you I can
 Don't have to rely on my own strength.</lyrics>
