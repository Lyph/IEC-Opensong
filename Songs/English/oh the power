<lyrics>[V1]
 Knees to the earth
 That You breathed by Your word
 As You watched the darkness come
 Crushed by the weight of the cost
 As You prayed, &quot;Not my will but Yours be done&quot;
 Gethsemane, where Heaven met me

[C1]
   Redeemer, crowned in endless praise
   My Savior, name above all names
   King Jesus
   take the highest place

[V2]
 There on the hill,
 You surrendered Your will
 For they know not what they do&quot;
 Grief in Your heart,
 Your hands bear the scars
 of a love that led You to the tomb
 Calvary, where Heaven met me

[C2]
   Redeemer, crowned in endless praise
   My Savior, name above all names
   King Jesus
   take the highest place

[B1]
   Oh, the power of the cross
   Oh, the power of Your blood
   Oh, the power of the cross
   Oh, the power of Your blood
   Oh, the power of the cross
   Oh, the power of Your blood

[C3]
   Oh darkness,
   You have lost Your strength
   Oh Hell, You lost everything
   King Jesus
   take the highest place

[V3]
 Oh, the power of the cross
 Oh, the power of Your blood
 Oh, the power of the cross
 Oh, the power of Your blood</lyrics>
