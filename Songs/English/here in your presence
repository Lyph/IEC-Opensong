<lyrics>[V1]
 Found in Your hands, fullness of joy
 Every fear suddenly wiped away here in Your presence
 All of my gains now fade away
 Every crown no longer on display, here in Your presence

[P1]
   Heaven in trembling in awe of Your wonders
   the kings and their kingdom arestanding amazed

[C1]
   Here in Your presence, we are undone
   Here in Your presence, Heaven and Earth become one
   Here in Your presence, all things are new
   Here in Your presence, everything bows before You

[B1]
   Wonderful, beautiful, glorious, matchlessin every way</lyrics>
