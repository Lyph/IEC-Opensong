.       Am
 And he set me on fire and I am burning alive.
.           F
 With his breath in my lungs, I am coming undone. (2X)

[P1]
.  Em                   Am
   And I cannot hold it in
.         G       F
   and remain composed.
.  Em                Am    G     F
   Love's taken over me so I propose
.                                             C
   The letting myself go. I am letting myself go.

[C1]
.  F
   You are my joy, You are my joy,
.                              C  G/B
   You are my joy, You are my joy. (2X)</lyrics>
