<lyrics>[V1]
 Praise God from whom all blessings flow,
 Praise Him all creatures here below.
 Praise Him above you heavenly host,
 Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

[V2]
 Give glory to the Father,
 Give glory to the Son,
 Give glory to the Spirit,
 While endless ages run.
 &quot;Worthy the Lamb&quot; all heaven cries,
 &quot;To be exalted thus&quot;:
 &quot;Worthy the Lamb&quot; our hearts reply,
 &quot;For He was slain for us.&quot;</lyrics>
