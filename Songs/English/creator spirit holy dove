<lyrics>[V1]
 Come, God Creator, Holy Ghost, And visit Thou these souls of men; Fill them with graces, as Thou dost, Thy creatures make pure again.

[V2]
 For Comforter Thy name we call. Sweet gift of God most high above, A holy unction to us all O Fount of life, Fire of love.

[V3]
 Our minds illumine and refresh, Deep in our hearts let love burn bright; Thou know'st the weakness of our flesh; And strengthen us with Thy might.

[V4]
 Thou with Thy wondrous sev'nfold gifts The finger art of God's right hand; The Father's Word Thou sendest swift On tongues of fire to each land.

[V5]
 Drive far from us our wily foe; Grant us Thy bless√©d peace within, That in Thy footsteps we may go, And shun the dark ways of sin.

[V6]
 Teach us the Father well to know,
 Likewise His only Son our Lord,
 Thyself to us believing show,
 Spirit of both, aye adored

[V7]
 Praise to the Father, and the Son
 Who from the dead is risen again;
 Praise to the Comforter be done
 Both now and ever. Amen.</lyrics>
