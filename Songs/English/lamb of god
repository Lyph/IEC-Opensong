.G                          C   Am
 Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God,

 Light of the World, Holy One.
.            G                    C     Am
 The name of Jesus, sweet name of Jesus,

 Rock of Salvation, Messiah is come!

   With humble hearts we raise

   A song of hope and thanks.
.       G
   We rejoice in Your grace.

   We rejoice in Your grace.
.     C G
