<lyrics>[V1]
 Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah, Pilgrim through this barren land. I am weak, but Thou art mighty; Hold me with Thy pow'rful hand. Bread of Heaven, Bread of Heaven, Feed me till I want no more; Feed me till I want no more.

[V2]
 Open now the crystal fountain, Whence the healing stream doth flow; Let the fire and cloudy pillar Lead me all my journey through. Strong Deliv'rer, strong Deliv'rer, Be Thou still my Strength and Shield; Be Thou still my Strength and Shield.

[V3]
 Lord, I trust Thy mighty power, Wondrous are Thy works of old; Thou deliver'st Thine from thralldom, Who for naught themselves had sold: Thou didst conquer, Thou didst conquer, Sin, and Satan and the grave, Sin, and Satan and the grave.

[V4]
 When I tread the verge of Jordan, Bid my anxious fears subside; Death of deaths, and hell's destruction, Land me safe on Canaan's side. Songs of praises, songs of praises, I will ever give to Thee; I will ever give to Thee.

[V5]
 Musing on my habitation, Musing on my heav'nly home, Fills my soul with holy longings: Come, my Jesus, quickly come; Vanity is all I see; Lord, I long to be with Thee! Lord, I long to be with Thee!</lyrics>
