 Intro: Bm D x2
.            Bm        A      D

.       Em        Bm                        A        D
 By the spirit of power, that raised Christ from the dead
.            Bm         A   D
 let now the poor stand and confess

 that my portion is him, and I'm more than blessed

.  Bm
    Let now our hearts burn with a flame
.  G                         D          A
    A fire consuming all for your son's holy name
.  Bm                              G             Em  A (pause)
    And with the heavens we declare, you are our King

 Let now your church shine as your bride
.         Em          Bm                    A       D
 that you saw in your heart, as you offered up your life
.            Bm         A     D
 let now the lost be welcomed home
.       Em          Bm                    A       D
 by the saved and redeemed, those adopted as your own

[C2]
.  D                            Bm
   You asked your son, to carry this
.            A                    D
   The heavy cross, our weight of sin
.  D                          Bm
   I love you Lord, I worship you
.                 A                   D
   Hope which was lost, Now stands renewed
.  E                        Bm
   I give my life, to honor this
.              A                  D
   The love of Christ, the Savior King</lyrics>
