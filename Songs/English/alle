.        E           B
 May the path that I walk
.       A                B
 Be the path of righteousness.
.        E           B
 May the words of my mouth
.         A
 Give You praise.

.       E             B
 May my heart be Your home
.      A             B
 And a place for holiness.
.       A              B
 I will worship You in love.
.       A                  B
 I will lift You, lift You up.
