<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me; Bless Thy little lamb tonight; Through the darkness be Thou near me; Watch my sleep till morning light.

[V2]
 All this day thy hand has led me, And I thank Thee for Thy care; Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me, Listen to my evening prayer.

[V3]
 Let my sins be all forgiven; Bless the friends I love so well; Take me, when I die, to heaven, Happy there with Thee to dwell.</lyrics>
