.F#m           E         F#m
 I've got a story to tell,
.    E           F#m
 and I am learning
.              E
 You've got a story as well,
.D                                    F#m
 Flowing through us, making us who we are.
.F#m             E              F#m            E
 And just like a river that runs, the story of Jesus comes
.  D                     A
 Into our hearts so that we can know
.  D                      E
 a love so great, it will overflow.

[C1]
.  A                 E            F#m
   Let the river run wild and free,
.                    D
   the river of Your love for me.
.          A            E                D
   Fill my heart and my soul 'till I overflow.

.F#m       E                F#m       E
 This is a time to be real, this is a time for courage,
.D              A                 D            E
 Time for going deeper still, for letting go into His will.

   the river of Your love for me.

   Fill my heart and my soul 'till I overflow.

   Let the river run wild and free,
