<lyrics>[V1]
 Blind Bartimaeus at the gates Of Jericho in darkness waits: He hears the crowd; he hears a breath say &quot;It is Christ of Nazareth!&quot; And calls in tones of agony, &quot;O Jesus, Jesus pity me!&quot;

[V2]
 The thronging multitudes in-crease &quot;Blind Bartimaeus, hold thy peace!&quot; But still, above the noisy crowd, The blind man's cry is shrill and loud: Until they say, &quot;He calleth thee; Courage! arise! He calleth thee!&quot;

[V3]
 Then saith the Christ, as silent stands The crowd, &quot;What wilt thou at My hands?&quot; And he replies, &quot;O give me light! Rabbi, restore the blind man's sight.&quot; And Jesus answers, &quot;Go thy way, Thy faith, thy faith hath savèd thee.&quot;

[V4]
 Ye that hath eyes and cannot see, In darkness and in misery, Recall those mighty voices three\&quot;O Jesus, Jesus pity me!&quot; &quot;Courage! arise! He calleth thee!&quot; &quot;Thy faith, thy faith hath savèd thee.&quot;</lyrics>
