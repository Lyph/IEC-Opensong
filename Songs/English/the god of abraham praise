 The God of Abr'ham praise, Who reigns enthroned above; Ancient of everlasting days, and God of Love; Jehovah, great I AM! by earth and Heav'n confessed; I bow and bless the sacred Name forever blessed.

[V2]
 The God of Abr'ham praise, at Whose supreme command From earth I rise and seek the joys at His right hand; I all on earth forsake, its wisdom, fame, and pow'r; And Him my only Portion make, my Shield and Tow'r.

[V3]
 The God of Abr'ham praise, Whose all sufficient grace Shall guide me all my happy days, in all my ways. He calls a worm His friend, He calls Himself my God! And He shall save me to the end, thro' Jesus' blood.

[V4]
 He by Himself has sworn; I on His oath depend, I shall, on eagle wings upborne, to Heav'n ascend. I shall behold His face; I shall His pow'r adore, And sing the wonders of His grace forevermore.

[V5]
 Tho' nature's strength decay, and earth and hell withstand, To Canaan's bounds I urge my way, at His command. The wat'ry deep I pass, with Jesus in my view; And thro' the howling wilderness my way pursue.

[V6]
 The goodly land I see, with peace and plenty bless'd;
 A land of sacred liberty, and endless rest.
 There milk and honey flow, and oil and wine abound,
 And trees of life forever grow with mercy crowned.

[V7]
 There dwells the Lord our King, the Lord our righteousness,
 Triumphant o'er the world and sin, the Prince of peace;
 On Sion's sacred height His kingdom still maintains,
 And glorious with His saints in light forever reigns.

[V8]
 He keeps His own secure, He guards them by His side,
 Arrays in garments, white and pure, His spotless bride:
 With streams of sacred bliss, with groves of living joys -
 With all the fruits of Paradise, He still supplies.

[V9]
 Before the great Three-One they all exulting stand;
 And tell the wonders He hath done, through all their land:
 The list'ning spheres attend, and swell the growing fame;
 And sing, in songs which never end, the wondrous Name.

[V10]
 The God Who reigns on high the great archangels sing,
 And &quot;Holy, holy, holy!&quot; cry, &quot;Almighty King!
 Who was, and is, the same, and evermore shall be:
 Jehovah - Father - great I AM, we worship Thee!&quot;

[V11]
 Before the Savior's face the ransomed nations bow;
 O'erwhelmed at His almighty grace, forever new:
 He shows His prints of love - they kindle to a flame!
 And sound thro' all the worlds above the slaughtered Lamb.

[V12]
 The whole triumphant host give thanks to God on high;
 &quot;Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,&quot; they ever cry.
 Hail, Abraham's God, and mine! (I join the heav'nly lays,)
 All might and majesty are Thine, and endless praise.</lyrics>
