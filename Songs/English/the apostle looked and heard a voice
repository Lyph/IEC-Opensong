<lyrics>[V1]
 Th'Apostle looked and heard a voice, He saw a Lamb as had been slain; As angels bowed and saints gave praise These words were heard in their refrain. &quot;There'll be no war or foe to fight, No searing sun, no dread of night; No more distress, no more restraint, No more be weak, no more feel faint. No more be weak, no more feel faint.

[V2]
 They sigh no more, gone are their fears, No crying make, shed no more tears; They grow not old, sense no more loss, Gone are their doubts and all their dross. There'll be no sin and no more stain, Unknown is sickness, gone is pain; The death of death, no more the hearse, The end of grief, the end of curse. The end of grief, the end of curse.&quot;

[V3]
 These words are spoken faithfully, Alpha, Omega, Lord is He; For all is done and done for all, For all who come, for all who call. Come see His face, His hands, His feet, Come quench your thirst, partake the Feast, Come enter in while still you may, Then Jesus bring Eternal Day. Then Jesus bring Eternal Day.</lyrics>
