<lyrics>[V1]
 I'm sorry Lord for all the wasted time
 The days I spent in masquerade
 I used to call myself a child of God
 I didn't think I needed change

[P1]
   You said faith without works is dead, you told me so
   So I stand here alone and I'm asking to be changed

[C1]
   Cause I'm bound to see the way things are supposed to be
   I'm ready to follow you
   I'm ready to follow through
   And I'm bound to see the change you say you'll work in me
   I'm ready to be so true
   I'm ready to follow you

[B1]
   Ready to bend, ready to break
   Not knowing where I'll go
   Ready to be the one you see
   As I stand before you Lord

[B2]
   I'm bound to see your glory
   I'm bound to see your grace
   I'm bound to see your mercy Lord
   And I'm bound to be changed</lyrics>
