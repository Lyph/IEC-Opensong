<lyrics>[V1]
.    F          Am   F         C       G
 The fullness of Your grace is here with me.
.      F        Am      F       C     G
 The richness of Your beauty's all I see.
.    F            Am      F    C      G
 The brightness of Your glory has arrived.
.         F           Am     F          C     G
 In Your presence, God, I'm completely satisfied.

[C1]
.       F            C   G
   For You I sing, I dance,
.    F                    C    G
   Rejoice in this divine romance,
.       F             G   Am
   Lift my heart and my hands
.              G                 F
   To show my love, to show my love.

[V2]
.           F          Am        F     C          G
 There's a deep, deep flood, An ocean flows from You,
.    F          Am              F      C        G
 Of deep, deep love, yeah, it's filling up the room.
.      F          Am        F        C      G
 Your innocent blood has washed my guilty life.
.         F        Am        F          C     G
 In Your presence, God, I'm completely satisfied.</lyrics>
