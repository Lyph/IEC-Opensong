<lyrics>[V1]
 VERSE
.Bbm        Ab     Db
 In the fall you were there
.       Gb         Ab
 Grace began before I was aware
.   Bbm           Ab    Db
 A shame too great for me to hide
.       Gb          Ab
 Covered now because of Jesus Christ

[V2]
 CHORUS
.Db       Bbm   Ab
 I can't believe
.            Bbm
 The price you paid for me
.            Gb
 What you did not owe

[V3]
 So that I could know you
.Db    Bbm    Ab
 How can it be
.            Bbm
 You chose someone like me
.             Gb
 To declare your praise
.             Bbm    (Ab Gb)
 For the glory of your name

[V4]
 VERSE
.Bbm        Ab   Db
 To the one who gave it all
.      Gb               Ab
 I belong with all my heart and soul
.Bbm         Ab     Db
 And every gain I count as loss
.       Gb            Ab
 When I survey the wonder of the cross

[V5]
 BRIDGE
.Ab          Db     Gb  Bbm
 You gave your life upon a cross
.Ab         Db    Gb   Db
 To make your home within my heart
.Ab          Db     Gb  Bbm
 Oh what a faithful God you are
.Ab           Db   Gb    Db
 Your praise forever in my heart</lyrics>
