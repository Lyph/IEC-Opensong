 When I am down and oh, my soul so weary
 When troubles come and my heart burdened be
 Then I am still and wait here in the silence
 Until You come and sit awhile with me

[C1]
   You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
   You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
   I am strong when I am on Your shoulders
   You raise me up to more than I can be

[V2]
 There is no life, no life without its hunger
 Each restless heart beats so imperfectly
 But when You come and I am filled with wonder
 Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity</lyrics>
