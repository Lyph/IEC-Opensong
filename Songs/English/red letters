.C      Fm
 Pages, Filled with the holy message
.Fm
 Sealed with a kiss from heaven
.     C            G
 On a scroll, long ago
.C        Fm
 Phrases, words that were bound together
.Fm
 Now have the power to sever
.       C          G
 Like a sword, evermore

[P1]
.  Eb
   Heed the words divinely spoken
.  Gm
   May your restless heart be broken
.  Cm                        Fm  EbDm
   Let the supernatural take hold

[C1]
.           C           Ab  Fm
   There is love in the red letters
.           C            Ab  Fm
   There is truth in the red letters
.           Eb
   There is hope for the hopeless
.  G
   Peace and forgiveness
.           Ab              Fm
   There is life in the red letters
.             C
   In the red letters

[V2]
.C       Fm
 One man came to reveal a mystery
.Fm
 Changing the course of history
.         C            G
 Made the claim he was God
.C        Fm
 Ageless, born of a virgin Mary
.Fm
 Spoke with a voice that carried
.            C             G
 through the years it persevered</lyrics>
