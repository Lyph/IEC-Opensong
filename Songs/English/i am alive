.Am                   Dm               G                                  C
 Many years ago I was petrified, I was stealing, lusting, blaspheming and telling many lies
.      F                       Dm
 I was on my way to Hell all because of my great sin,
.         E
 Then You came into my life, I just had to let You in
.        Am             Dm             G                                C
 So come on, walk in my door, when You touched my heart oh Lord, all my tears began to flow
.        F                              Dm
 No more hopeless days and nights of my being all alone,
.    E
     Now You're in my life and I'm a part of Your great home

[V2]
.Am                        Dm             G                        C
 And I'm free to stay with You, Light has come into my life, our relationship brand new
.    F                                    Dm
 You said You'd never leave me, and You'd never let me go
.       E
 That's why my eyes are on You, that's why You are my Lord.
.       Am             Dm            G                             C
 So let me, stay on my knees, always keep me close to You, hold me Jesus, will You please?
.     F                           Dm
 Your precious life You gave, and by Your blood You save
.      E
 I'm redeemed, and from prison I'm set free!

[C1]
.     Am       Dm         G                             C
   Oh I, I am alive, once dead in my great sin, now I'm happy by Your side
.     F                     Dm
   Forever I will live, one day will do no wrong
.       E
   I'll be with You forever, and in my heart there is a song
.     Am       Dm         G                             C
   Oh I, I am alive, once dead in my great sin, now I'm happy by Your side
.     F                     Dm
   Forever I will live, one day will do no wrong
.        E
   I am alive, I am alive! Hey, hey!</lyrics>
