<lyrics>[V1]
.G    G/B      C
 I am full of Earth. You are heaven's worth.
.G    G/B          C
 I am stained with dirt, prone to depravity.
.G       G/B      C
 You are everything that is bright and clean.
.G       G/B    C
 The antonym of me,
 You are divinity.

[P1]
.  G/B    C               G        D/F#
   But a certain sign of grace is this:
.  G/B        C            G      D/F#
   From the broken earth, flowers come up,
.  D
   Pushing through the dirt.

[C1]
.           C    G     D
   You are holy, holy, holy.
.                   C      G     D
   All heaven cries holy, holy, God.
.           C    G     D
   You are holy, holy, holy.
.                C   G         D
   I want to be holy like You are.

[V2]
.G       G/B      C
 You are everything that is bright and clean,
.G           G/B   C
 And You're covering me with your majesty.

[P2]
.  G/B       C              G       D/F#
   And the truest sign of grace was this:
.  G/B    C            G               D/F#  D
   From wounded hands, redemption fell down, liberating man.

[B1]
.  F                 C                        G
   But the harder I try, the more clearly can I
.                        D/F#
   Feel the depth of our fall and the weight of it all.
.  C                       G/B
   And so this might could be
.                       G
   The most impossible thing:
.                  D/F#             C
   Your grandness in me making me clean.
.  G      D
   Glory, hallelujah,
.  C      G      D
   Glory, glory, hallelujah...

[B2]
.  C             G          D        Em
   So here I am, all of me, finally, everything,
.  C       G       D
   Wholly, wholly, wholly.
.         C     G        D
   I am wholly, wholly, wholly,
.         C     G        D       G  G/B C
   I am wholly, wholly, wholly Yours.
.                 G  G/B
   I am wholly Yours.
.  C
    
.  G                G/B                 C
   And I am full of earth and dirt and You.
.  Em      C  Em       C
   Here I am, everything.</lyrics>
