<lyrics>[C1]
   I walk by faith, each step by faith
   To live by faith, I put my trust in You.
   I walk by faith, each step by faith
   To live by faith, I put my trust in You.

[V1]
 Every step I take is a step of faith
 No weapon formed against me shall prosper
 And every prayer I make is a prayer of faith
 And if my God is for me
 Then who can be against me?</lyrics>
