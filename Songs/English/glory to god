<lyrics>[V1]
.G/B        C2(no3)       G
 Before the world was made,
.           Dsus
 before You spoke it to be,
.G/B         C2(no3)       G
 You were the King of Kings.
.              Dsus
 Yeah, You were. Yeah, You were.
.G/B            C2(no3)       G
 And now You're reigning still,
.           Dsus
 enthroned above all things.
.G/B        C2(no3)       G
 Angels and saints cry out;
.            Dsus
 we join them as we sing:

[C1]
.  Cmaj9     G
   Glory to God,
.  Dsus     Em7
   glory to God,
.  Cmaj9     G        D(4)
   Glory to God, forever. (2X)

[V2]
.G/B    C2(no3)       G
 Creator God, You gave
.            Dsus
 me breath so I could praise
.G/B            C2(no3)       G
 Your great and matchless name
.           Dsus
 all my days, all my days.
.G/B       C2(no3)      G
 So let my whole life be
.           Dsus
 a blazing offering,
.G/B         C2(no3)         G
 A life that shouts and sings
.              Dsus
 the greatness of our King.

[B1]
.  C                G
   Take my life and let it be
.  Dsus            Em7
   All for You and for Your glory.
.  C                G         Dsus
   Take my life and let it be Yours. (2X)</lyrics>
