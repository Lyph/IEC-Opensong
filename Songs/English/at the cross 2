<lyrics>[V1]
.D   G                A   Bm  D    G       A
  Oh Lord You've searched me,  You know my way

  Even when I fail You, I know You love me

[V2]
.D     G    A   Bm  D    G        A
  Your Holy presence, Surrounding me
.D   G     A  Bm   G          Asus A   G          Asus A
  In every season, I Know You love me, I know You love me

[C1]
.  D                      Bm
    At the cross I bow my knee
.                       D        G
   Where your blood was shed for me
.                          A
   There's no greater love than this
.  D                      Bm
    You have overcome the grave
.                       D       G
   Your glory fills the highest place
.                       A   G D G A x2
   What can separate me know

[V3]
.D    G    A    Bm  D    G         A
  You go before me,  You shield my way
.D     G      A     Bm  G          Asus A
  Your hand upholds me, I know You love me

[B1]
.               G     A          Bm
   You tore the veil, You made a way
.           G          Bm    A    end: G D G A x2
   When You said that 'It is done'

[V4]
.D    G        A     Bm    D      G       A
  And when the earth fades, Falls from my eyes
.D        G       A    Bm  G          Asus A   G          Asus A
  And You stand before me, I know You love me, I know You love me</lyrics>
