 I will be yours, you will be mine
 Together in eternity
 Our hearts of love will be entwined
 Together in eternity
 Forever in eternity

[V2]
 I will be yours, you will be mine
 Together in eternity
 Our hearts of love will be entwined
 Together in eternity
 Forever in eternity

[B1]
   No more tears of pain in our eyes
   No more fear or shame
   For we will be with you
   Yes, we will be with you</lyrics>
