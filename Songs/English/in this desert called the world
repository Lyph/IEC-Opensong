<lyrics>[V1]
 In this desert called the world
 I will walk both day and night
 With the guidance of your Spirit
 I will walk with a joyful heart

[V2]
 I will walk with love
 I will walk with your Spirit
 I will walk with pleasure
 With you by my side (through eternity)

[V3]
 On this path that we call life
 I will walk on rocky ground
 With you, Jesus, in my heart
 I will walk without fear</lyrics>
