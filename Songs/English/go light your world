<lyrics>[V1]
 There is a candle in every soul
 Some brightly burning, some dark and cold
 There is a Spirit who brings fire
 Ignites a candle and makes His home

[C1]
   Carry your candle, run to the darkness
   Seek out the hopeless, confused and torn
   Hold out your candle for all to see it
   Take your candle, and go light your world
   Take your candle, and go light your world

[V2]
 Frustrated brother, see how he's tried to
 Light his own candle some other way
 See now your sister, she's been robbed and lied to
 Still holds a candle without a flame

[C2]
   Carry your candle, run to the darkness
   Seek out the lonely, the tired and worn
   Hold out your candle for all to see it
   Take your candle, and go light your world
   Take your candle, and go light your world

[V3]
 We are a family whose hearts are blazing
 So let's raise our candles and light up the sky
 Praying to our Father, in the name of Jesus
 Make us a beacon in darkest times

[C3]
   Carry your candle, run to the darkness
   Seek out the helpless, deceived and poor
   Hold out your candle for all to see it
   Take your candle, and go light your world

[C4]
   Carry your candle, run to the darkness
   Seek out the hopeless, confused and torn
   Hold out your candle for all to see it
   Take your candle, and go light your world
   Take your candle, and go light your world</lyrics>
