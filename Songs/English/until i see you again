.   D     G         Bm A/C#
 Oh child, precious one
.         D   G               Bm A/C#
 Let your life shine like the sun

[P1]
.             G                    A
   But you say &quot;How long 'til I can come home
.            Bm                  A/C#
   'Til I can rest in your arms again&quot;
.           G                        A
   And I say &quot;Not long but don't miss this life
.             Bm            A/C#
   And I'll be waiting 'til then&quot;

[C1]
.                G           D
   Live with the wonder of a child
.                 G           A    Bm
   Pray with your arms thrown open wide
.              G         A      Bm
   Love with a love that has no end
.        G     A    G   (A)
   Until I see you again

[V2]
.   D     G         Bm A/C#
 Oh child, precious one
.          D     G             Bm   A/C#
 With each breath know you are loved

[B1]
.        G     A    G
   Until I see you again
.          G        A    D
   Oh, and I'll see you again.</lyrics>
