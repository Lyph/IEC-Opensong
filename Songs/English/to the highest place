 Lyrics:
 Before the earth was made You were living
 And over every heart You've been singing
 Your very word spoke life into being
 You even give the breath we are breathing

[V2]
 And now, we sing our songs back to You
 Oh Lord, we gladly lay down our lives at Your feet
 We take the breath You gave
 And we give it back in praise
 You are exalted to the highest place
 You have the name above all other names

[V3]
 Stepping down into a world You made
 The uncreated God in a human frame
 Creator dwelling with creation
 You made Yourself of no reputation

[V4]
 And You made Yourself nothing for us
 And You gave up Your life for the least of men
 You entered the gates of death
 But rose with the keys in Your hands

[V5]
 There is no one like You, There is none besides You</lyrics>
