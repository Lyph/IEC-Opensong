<lyrics>[V1]
 Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole; I want Thee forever to live in my soul, Break down ev'ry idol, cast out ev'ry foe; Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow. Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow; Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

[V2]
 Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies, And help me to make a complete sacrifice; I give up myself, and whatever I know, Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow. Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow; Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

[V3]
 Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat, I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet, By faith, for my cleansing, I see Thy blood flow, Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow. Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow; Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

[V4]
 Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait, Come now, and within me a new heart create; To those who have sought Thee, Thou never said'st ''No,'' Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow. Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow; Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</lyrics>
