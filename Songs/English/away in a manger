<lyrics>[V1]
. F        Gm/F       Bb         F
 Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
.    C7                    Bb/F           F
 The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head
.    F            Gm/F       Bb            F
 The stars in the sky looked down where he lay
.    C7          F      Gm/Bb        F
 The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

[V2]
. F             Gm/F        Bb    F
 The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes;
.    C7                    Bb/F      F
 But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes;
.  F               Gm/F        Bb            F
 I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky;
.    C7         F           Gm/Bb      F
 And stay by my cradle 'til morning is nigh.

[V3]
. F               Gm/F     Bb          F
 Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay,
.      C7                 Bb/F       F
 Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
.      F            Gm/F        Bb         F
 Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care,
.    C7         F         Gm/Bb          F
 And fit us for Heaven to live with Thee there.</lyrics>
