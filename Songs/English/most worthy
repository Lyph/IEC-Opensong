<lyrics>[V1]
 All Your ways are just, all Your ways are true
 All around the world let Your Name be lifted high
 God who hears our prayers, God who heals and cares
 All around the world let Your Name be lifted high

[V2]
 Most worthy of praise, Most worthy of praise
 Higher than the highest and the Name above all names

[V3]
 Self-Existent One, Everlasting Love
 Author of all hope, Father to the fatherless
 All will see Your face, and Your praise will sound
 All around the world as Your glory fills the skies

[V4]
 More and more glory to You (x3)
 More and more worship, more and more praise</lyrics>
