 Verse: 1
.     D
 Let me be filled
.   G     A           D
 With kindness and compassion for the one
.  G         A/C#          Hm
 The one for whom you   loved and gave your son
.  G     A      D
 For humanity increase my love

   Chorus:
.       G         A       D
   Help me to love with open arms like you do
.         G         A             D
   A love that erases all the lines and sees the truth
.         G        A          Hm
   Oh that when they look in my eyes they would see You
.           G           A         D
   Even in just a smile they would feel the Father's love

 You formed us, You   made us carefully

   Let all my life   tell of who you are

   And the wonder of Your    never-ending love
.    A       D/F#             G
