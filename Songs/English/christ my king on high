<lyrics>[V1]
 Lord, my sin, it grieves me so. How I long for my Lord to come. Bless my God who clothes me bright, wraps me pure in heav'n's Great Light.

[V2]
 Spotless Lamb made sin for me. God, Great Judge, just always be. Sealed on high with Christ's Great Pledge never more shall death I dread.

[V3]
 One with Him, I stand secure, Safe in Triune hands I'm sure. Christ's great merits giv'n to me. I now hear Him say, &quot;Whom I'm pleased.&quot;

[V4]
 Long to see the skies burn bright, heaven's hosts all clothed in white. See the King, His vic'try won. Come, pure Bride behold the Son.</lyrics>
