<lyrics>[V1]
.     Cm              Gm
 I am a thief, I am a murderer
.          F             Cm
 Walking up this lonely hill.
.          Cm                   Gm
 What have I done? I don't remember.
.         F                  Cm
 No one knows just how I feel.
.       G           Bb         Cm
 And I know that my time is coming soon.

[V2]
.        Cm          Gm
 It's been so long. Oh, such a long time
.   F                 Cm
 Since I've lived with peace and rest.
.       Cm                  Gm
 Now I am here, at my destination.
.       F               Gm
 Guess things work for the best.
.       G           Bb         Cm
 And I know that my time is coming soon.

[V3]
.          Cm        Gm
 Who is this man? This man beside me
.     F              Cm
 They call the King of the Jews.
.       Cm            Gm
 They don't believe that he's the Messiah,
.     F                Cm
 But somehow I know that it's true.

[V4]
.      G
 And they laugh at Him in mockery
.      Bb          Cm
 And beat him till He bleeds.
.      G
 They nail Him to the rugged cross,
.       Bb           F           Cm
 And raise Him, they raise him up next to me.

[V5]
.            Cm                Gm
 My time has come. I'm slowly fading,
.      F            Cm
 But I deserve what I receive.
.         Cm                Gm
 Jesus, when you are in Your Kingdom
.       F              Cm
 Could You please remember me?

[V6]
.           G
 And He looks at me still holding on.
.       Bb                 Cm
 The tears fall from His eyes.
.     G
 He says, &quot;I tell the truth:
.Bb           F              Cm
 Today, you will be with Me in paradise.&quot;

[B1]
.        G         Eb               Cm
   And I know that my time is coming soon.
.        G         Eb               Cm
   And I know that my time is coming soon.
.        G         Bb                           Cm
   And I know that paradise, paradise is coming soon.</lyrics>
