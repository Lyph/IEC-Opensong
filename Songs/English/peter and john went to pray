 Peter and John went to pray.
 they met a lame man on the way
 He asked for alms and held out his palms,
 and this is what Peter did say&quot;
 Silver and gold have I none,
 but such as I have give I you.
 In the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, in Jesus' name rise up and walk.

[V2]
 The man went walking and leaping and praising God,
 Walking and leaping and praising God,
 &quot;In the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, In Jesus' name rise up and walk&quot;.</lyrics>
