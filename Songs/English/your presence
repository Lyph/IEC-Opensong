.      D
 Your Presence is all I need

 It's all I want, all I seek
.     G         Bm                 A
 Without it, without it there's no meaning
.     D
 Your Presence is the air I breathe
.    A/C#              A     A/F#
 The song I sing, the love I need
.     G        Bm                  A
 Without it, without it I'm not living
