.E                      Asus2
 Every sun and moon and star,
.                      C#m
 All declaring who You are,
.                  Bsus
 We fall silent in amazement.
.E                      Asus2
 Every word and deed of man,
.                       C#m
 Every sea and grain of sand, all creation speaks,
.    Bsus
 And now we sing to proclaim Your majesty.

[C1]
.  Asus2                  E
   Let the earth rejoice, singing with one voice.
.  Bsus                 C#m
   Let the people cry, &quot;Holy, holy, Lord.&quot;
.  Asus2               E
   Every creature sing praises to the King.
.  Bsus               C#m
   All creation cry, &quot;Holy is the Lord.&quot;

[V2]
.E                      Asus2
 Every song sung on the earth
.                             C#m
 Will never capture all Your worth;
.                  Bsus
 We fall silent in amazement.
.E                          Asus2
 Let every humble heart now see
.                      C#m
 The beauty of Your magesty; all creation speaks
.    Bsus
 And now we sing to the King above all Kings.</lyrics>
