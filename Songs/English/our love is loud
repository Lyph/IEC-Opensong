.          E F#          C#       A
 When we sing, hear our songs to you.
.         E   F#         C#      A
 When we dance, feel us move to you.
.          E  F#           C#         A
 When we laugh, fill out smiles with you.
.          E             F#
 When we lift our voices louder still,
.C#
 Can You hear us;

 Can You feel?
