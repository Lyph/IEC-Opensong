<lyrics>[V1]
.D              G       D    G       D    A
 Man of sorrows Lamb of God, by His own betrayed
.    Bm             G        Bm      G       A     D
 The sin of man and wrath of God has been on Jesus laid

[V2]
.D            G         D    G      D          A
 Silent as He stood accused, beaten mocked and scorned
.Bm            G        Bm       G      A        D
 Bowing to the Father's will, he took a crown of thorns

[C1]
.          Bm     G           D A
   Oh that rugged cross my salvation
.             Bm          G       A
   Where your love poured out over me
.          G         D        A Bm
   Now my soul cries out hallelujah
.             G      A    D
   Praise and honour unto Thee

[V3]
.D              G         D      G        D    A
 Sent of heaven God's own Son to purchase and redeem
.    Bm            G    Bm        G         A       D
 And reconcile the very ones who nailed Him to that tree

[B1]
.         Bm      G           D       A
   Now my debt is paid, it is paid in full
.         Bm       G             D        A
   By the precious blood that my Jesus spilled
.          Bm       G          D       A
   Now the curse of sin has no hold on me
.           Bm       G          D      A
   Whom the son sets free oh is free indeed x2

[V4]
.D                G      D       G        D     A
 See the stone is rolled away, behold the empty tomb
.Bm         G         Bm         G     A        D
 Hallelujah God be praised, He's risen from the grave</lyrics>
