 Verse:
.      Gm          Dm             F          C
 All the Nations they will come, holding broken chains above their heads.
.      Gm      F              C
 Singing, &quot;We have overcome, by the blood of the Lamb.&quot;

[C1]
   Chorus:
.        Bb           Dm
   Jesus, you, you're worth it all
.         F            C
   Every Nation, Every Sou</lyrics>
