 VERSE 1:
 From Your sacrifice for the sake of all
 Redemption's birth and relentless hope
 As the weight of grace crushed the face of love
 AndYou bled and died for Your enemies

[V2]
 VERSE 2:
 To woo us back from death and woe
 A valentine to a faithless world
 Every wayward heart You pursue us all
 And in kindness call us home

[C1]
   CHORUS:
   This world is Yours
   My God this world is Yours
   All You made to be Yours
   I know You love us all

[V3]
 VERSE 3:
 Your agape love displaces fear
 And the plan is working heaven's near
 For the kingdom comes to the heart
 That whispers
 Have mercy God on me

[V4]
 CHORUS 2:
 This world is Yours
 My God this world is Yours
 All You made to be Yours
 I know You love us all

[V5]
 All this world is Yours
 My God this world is Yours
 All You made to be Yours
 I know You love us all

[B1]
   BRIDGE:
   You reign forever
   You reign forevermore
   My heart surrendered
   You reign forevermore</lyrics>
