<lyrics>[V1]
.             D5
 Your love is deep.
.           D/G
 Your love is high.
.             Bm7  G2(no3)
 Your love is long.
.           A7sus
 Your love is wide. (2X)

[C1]
.               D
   Your love is deeper than my view of grace,
.  D2sus/G        D/G
   Higher than this worldly place,
.  Bm7            G(no3)
   Longer than this road I travel,
.  A2sus
   Wider than the gap You filled.

[B1]
.  G2(no3)               D
   So who shall separate us,
.  G2(no3)            D            A
   Who shall separate us from Your love?
.  G2(no3)              D
   Nothing can separate us,
.  G2(no3)              D            A
   Nothing can separate us from Your love.</lyrics>
