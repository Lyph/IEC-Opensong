<lyrics>[V1]
.  F              Gm
 O little town of Bethlehem,
.    F/C      C        F
 How still we see thee lie;
.          D        Gm
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep,
.    F      C        F
 The silent stars go by.
.           C7/G         A
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth
.    Dm          A
 The everlasting light;
.    F                  Gm
 The hopes and fears of all the years
.    F      C/F    F
 Are met in thee tonight.

[V2]
.    F              Gm
 For Christ is born of Mary,
.    F/C      C    F
 And gather'd all above,
.              D          Gm
 While mortals sleep, the angels keep
.      F        C         F
 Their watch of wond'ring love.
.          C7/G    A
 O morning stars together
.   Dm             A
 Proclaim the holy birth
.    F               Gm
 And praises sing to God the King
.    F        C/F    F
 And peace to men on earth.</lyrics>
