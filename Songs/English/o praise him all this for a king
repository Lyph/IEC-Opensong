<lyrics>[V1]
.G2               D/F#                C
 Turn your ear to heaven and hear the noise inside:
.    G2                        D/F#
 The sound of angels' awe, the sound of angels' songs,
.C                    Am7                     C
 All this for a King; we could join and sing, all to Christ the King.

[P1]
.  D/F#           C       D/F#              C
   How constant, how divine, this song of ours will rise.
.  D/F#             C        D/F#               C                 Am/C
   O, how constant, how divine, this love of ours will rise, will rise.

[C1]
.  G             G/F#          Em7         C       Am7
   O praise Him! O praise Him! He is Holy! He is Holy!

[V2]
.G2                   D/F#              C
 Turn your gaze to heaven and raise a joyous noise:
.    G2                            D/F#
 The sound of salvation come, the sound of rescued ones,
.C                    Am7                   C
 All this for a king; angels join to sing, all for Christ our King.

[B1]
.  G        D/F#    Em7     C2 Am7
    Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la.

[P2]
.  D/F#      C          D/F#               C
   How infinite and sweet, this love so rescuing.
.  D/F#           C         D/F#                    C
   O, how infinitely sweet, this great love that has redeemed.
.     Am/C        C
   As one we sing:

[C2]
.  G         G/F#      Em7         C       Am7  G
   Alleluia! Alleluia! He is Holy! He is Holy!__
.  G         G/F#      Em7         C       Am7  G
   Alleluia! Alleluia! He is Holy! He is Holy!__</lyrics>
