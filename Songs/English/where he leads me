<lyrics>[V1]
 I can hear my Savior calling, I can hear my Savior calling, I can hear my Savior calling, &quot;Take thy cross and follow, follow Me.&quot; Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow; I'll go with Him, with Him, all the way.

[V2]
 I'll go with Him through the garden, I'll go with Him through the garden, I'll go with Him through the garden, I'll go with Him, with Him all the way. Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow; I'll go with Him, with Him, all the way.

[V3]
 I'll go with Him through the judgment, I'll go with Him through the judgment, I'll go with Him through the judgment, I'll go with Him, with Him all the way. Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow; I'll go with Him, with Him, all the way.

[V4]
 He will give me grace and glory, He will give me grace and glory, He will give me grace and glory, And go with me, with me all the way. Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow, Where He leads me I will follow; I'll go with Him, with Him, all the way.</lyrics>
