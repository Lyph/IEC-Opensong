<lyrics>[V1]
.  Bm     A         D
 Jesus, I stand for You.
.          Bm       A       E
 No matter what You lead me through.
.          G        A       D        E
 They will chase me out and close me down,
.       G         A         D
 But, Jesus, I'll stand for You.

[C1]
.       G      A           D      Bm
   I'll always stand, I'll always stand,
.       G      A        D
   I'll always stand for You.
.       G      A           D      E
   I'll always stand, I'll always stand,
.       G      A         D
   I'll always stand for You.

[V2]
 Jesus, I've stood my ground
 When unbelief was all around.
 I have felt the sting rejection brings,
 But, Jesus, I'll stand for You.

[B1]
.              G   Em         A
   A time will come when everyone
.  D               G   Em            A   D
   Will turn their eyes on the risen Son.
.        G        D                    G     D
   But until that day, this world will turn away,
.           Bm
   And so I take Your hand;
.       G      A         D
   I'll always stand for You.

[B2]
.         G     A
   Guilty of disgrace,
.          D       E
   But You took my place,
.        G                Em        D
   So, Jesus, I'll always stand for You.</lyrics>
