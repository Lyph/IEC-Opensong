 I will wait for you, as long as it takes
 Giving up my life, over for love

[P1]
   You've been searching for, How you've been yearning for
   Hearts loyal to your own
   So when you search the earth, looking for your friends
   hear me sing my Lord

[C1]
   I am yours
   Yes I am
   Wholly Yours

[B1]
   You are my first love
   You are my only one
   Lord there is nothing else for me
   Where else can I go
   You have my heart alone
   You are the only home I need</lyrics>
