<title>Jesus Loves Me</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 [Verse 1]
 I was lost
 I was in chains
 The world had a hold of me

[V2]
 My heart was a stone
 I was covered in shame
 When He came for me

[V3]
 [Pre-Chorus]
 I couldn't run, couldn't run from His presence
 I couldn't run, couldn't run from His arms

[V4]
 [Chorus]
 Jesus, He loves me, He loves me, He is for me
 Jesus, how can it be, He loves me, He is for me

[V5]
 [Verse 2]
 And it was a fire
 Deep in my soul
 I'll never be the same

[V6]
 I stepped out of the dark
 And into the light
 When He called my name

[V7]
 [Pre-Chorus]
 [Chorus]

[V8]
 [Bridge]
 He holds the stars and He holds my heart
 With healing hands that bear the scars
 The rugged cross where He died for me
 My only hope, my everything

[V9]
 [Chorus]

[V10]
 [Outro]
 He loves me (x4)
 He is for me
 He loves me
 My God is amazing
 Jesus loves me</lyrics>
