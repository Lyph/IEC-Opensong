<lyrics>[V1]
 When the path is daunting
 And every step exhausting
 I'm not alone I'm not alone no no

[V2]
 I feel You draw me closer
 All these burdens on my shoulder
 I'm not alone I'm not alone
 You pull me from this place

[C1]
   Hallelujah! You carry me every day
   You carry me all the way
   Hallelujah! You carry me to the,
   You carry me to the cross

[V3]
 How Your love has moved me yeah
 To the foot of all Your glory
 I'm not alone I'm not alone
 I'm not alone

[B1]
   All of these cities You have built
   And every cathedral You have filled
   To all of creation You gave life with Your hands
   And with those hands you comfort me
   You lift me up from my knees and carry me
   You carry me</lyrics>
