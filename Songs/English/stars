.C                          Csus
 You should see the stars tonight,
.         C                 Csus
 How they shimmer, shine so bright.
.            C                   Csus
 Against the black, they look so white,
.       C                Csus
 Coming down from such a height
.            G                 F
 To reach me now; You reach me now.

[V2]
 You should see the moon in flight,
 Cutting 'cross the misty night,
 Softly dancing in sunshine.
 Reflections of it's light
 Reach me now; You reach me now.

[C1]
.  G                         F
   And how could such a thing
   shine it's light on me
.  G                  F
   And make ev'rything
   beautiful again?

[V3]
 You should feel the sun in spring,
 Coming out after a rain.
 Suddenly, all is green,
 Sunshine on ev'rything.
 I can feel it now; I feel You now.

[V4]
 You should hear the angels sing,
 All gathered 'round their King,
 More beautiful than you could dream.
 I've been quietly listening.
 You can hear them now; I hear them now.

[C2]
   And how could such a King
   shine His light on me
   And make ev'rything
   beautiful again?

[C3]
   And how could such a King shine His light on me
   And make ev'rything beautiful?

[B1]
.            G
   I want to shine; I want to be light.
.                       F
   I want to tell You, 'it'll be alright.'
.                G
   And I want to shine, and I want to fly,
.                      F
   Just to tell You, 'now it'll be alright.'
.             G      F .        G   F
   It'll be alright; It'll be alright.

[B2]
.  G                              F
   'Cause I've got nothing of my own to give to You.
.  G                             F
   But this light that shines on me shines on You
.                                   C   Csus
   And makes ev'rything beautiful again.
.             C   Csus          C
   It'll be alright; It'll be alright.</lyrics>
