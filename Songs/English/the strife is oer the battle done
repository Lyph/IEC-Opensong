<lyrics>[V1]
 Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. The strife is o'er, the battle done; The triumph of the Lord is won; O Let the song of praise be sung: Alleluia! Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

[V2]
 Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. The pow'rs of death have done their worst; and Jesus hath His foes dispersed; Let shouts of praise and joy outburst: Alleluia! Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

[V3]
 Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. On that third morn He rose again In glorious majesty to reign; O let us swell the joyful strain. Alleluia! Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

[V4]
 Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. He closed the yawning gates of hell; The bars from heav'ns high portals fell; Let songs of joy His triumphs tell. Alleluia! Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

[V5]
 Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Lord, by the stripes which wounded Thee, From death's dread sting Thy servants free, That we may live, and sing to Thee. Alleluia! Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.</lyrics>
