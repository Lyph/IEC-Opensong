<lyrics>[V1]
 Savior of the nations, come; Virgin's Son, here make Thy home! Marvel now, O heav'n and earth, That the Lord chose such a birth.

[V2]
 Not by human flesh and blood; By the Spirit of our God Was the Word of God made flesh, Woman's offspring, pure and fresh.

[V3]
 Wondrous birth! O wondrous Child Of the virgin undefiled! Though by all the world disowned, Still to be in heaven enthroned.

[V4]
 From the Father forth He came And returneth to the same, Captive leading death and hell High the song of triumph swell!

[V5]
 Thou, the Father's only Son, Hast o'er sin the vict'ry won. Boundless shall Thy kingdom be; When shall we its glories see?</lyrics>
