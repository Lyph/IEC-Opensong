<lyrics>[V1]
 Have mercy on me, O my God According to Your grace; According to Your tender Love Blot out transgressions great; For I acknowledge all my sin, Before my face they stand; Against You only have I sinned, There's evil on my hands.

[V2]
 O purge me now and I'll be clean, As clean and white as snow; O wash me in the Blood of Christ, Make me Your gladness know; Create in me a clean heart, Lord, Renew me thoroughly; Restore salvation's joy again, Uphold me tenderly.</lyrics>
