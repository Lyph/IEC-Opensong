<lyrics>[V1]
.E                         A   F#7
 There's within my heart a melody
.B                        E/B B7
 Jesus whispers sweet and low:
.E                         A        F#7
 &quot;Fear not I am with thee. Peace be still.&quot;
.B                E/B B7  E
 In all of life's ebb and flow.

[V2]
.E                          A       F#7
 All my life was wrecked by sin and strife;
.B                            E/B  B7
 Discord filled my heart with pain.
.E                      A      F#7
 Jesus swept across the broken strings;
.B                      E/B    B7 E
 Stirred the slumb'ring chords a__gain.

[V3]
.E                      A      F#7
 Feasting in the riches of His grace;
.B                            E/B  B7
 Resting neath His shelt'ring wing.
.E                     A       F#7
 Always looking on His smiling face:
.B             E/B   B7  E
 That is why I shout and sing.

[V4]
.E                                 A      F#7
 Though sometimes He leads through waters deep,
.B                      E/B B7
 Trials fall across the way;
.E                               A         F#7
 Though sometimes the path seems rough and steep;
.B                    E/B B7  E
 I see His footprints all the way.

[V5]
.E                        A       F#7
 Soon He's coming back to welcome me
.B                     E/B B7
 Far beyond the starry sky.
.E                         A        F#7
 I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown;
.B                  E/B B7 E
 I shall reign with Him on high.

[C1]
.  E             B
   Jesus, Jesus, Jesus;
.                B/E E
   Sweetest name I   know.
.                 A6
   Fills my every longing;
.  B                E/B B7 E
   Keeps me singing as  I  go.</lyrics>
