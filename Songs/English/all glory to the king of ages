 All glory to the King of ages
 All glory to the King of kings
 His name is Love, His name is Jesus
 Enthroned above in majesty

[V2]
 Into this world You came to save us
 You bore the cross, You took my sin
 You shone Your light into my darkness
 Unveiled the truth, this mystery

[V3]
 You are my God, You are my Saviour
 You are the Rock on which I stand

[V4]
 Ever-faithful God, I cling to You
 In every way You've shown that You are good
 There's no other love compares with You
 Forever strong, forever true
 Ever-faithful God, I cling to You

[V5]
 You are the end of all my searching
 You pour Your grace on my need
 Unfailing love, unending mercy
 Are found in You, The Prince of peace
 You are my God, You are my Saviour
 You are the rock on which I stand
 You are my God, You are my Saviour
 Eternal One, the Great I Am</lyrics>
