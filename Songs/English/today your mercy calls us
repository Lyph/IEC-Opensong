<lyrics>[V1]
 Today Thy mercy calls me to wash away my sin; However great my trespass, whate'er I may have been; However long from mercy I may have turned away, Thy blood, O Christ, can wash me, and make me clean today.

[V2]
 Today Thy gate is open, and all who enter in Shall find a Father's welcome, and pardon for their sin; The past shall be forgotten, a present joy be given; A future grace be promised, a glorious crown in Heav'n.

[V3]
 Today the Father calls me, the Holy Spirit waits, The bless√®d angels gather around the heav'nly gates; No question will be asked me, how often I have come; Although I oft have wandered, it is my Father's home.

[V4]
 O all embracing mercy, thou ever open door, What shall I do without thee when heart and eyes run o'er? When all things seem against me, to drive me to despair, I know one gate is open, one ear will hear my prayer.</lyrics>
