 I will run and not grow weary
 I will walk, I will not faint
 I will soar on wings like eagles
 Find my rest in your everlasting name

[C1]
   You are my revival
   Jesus on you I wait
   And I'll lean on your promise
   You will renew my strength

[V2]
 I will run and not grow weary
 I will walk, I will not faint
 I will soar on wings like eagles
 Find my rest in your everlasting name

[C2]
   You are my revival
   Jesus on you I wait
   And I'll lean on your promise
   You will renew my strength

[C3]
   Oh, you are my revival
   Jesus on you I wait
   I'll lean on your promise
   You will renew my strength
   Oh, you are my revival
   Jesus on you I wait
   I'll lean on your promise
   You will renew my strength
   Oh, you will renew my strength
   Oh, you will renew my strength

[V3]
 I will run and not grow weary
 I will walk, I will not faint
 I will soar on wings like eagles
 Find my rest in your everlasting name

[C4]
   You are my revival
   Jesus on you I wait
   And I'll lean on your promise
   You will renew my strength</lyrics>
