 Verse:
.        Em                      C
 Take me past the outer courts into the Holy Place
.D                            C                D
 Past the brazen alta Lord I want to see your face
.        Em                                C
 Pass me by the crowds of people and the Priests who sing your praise
.  D                                                 C                  D
 I hunger and thirst for your righteousness but it's only found in one place

[C1]
   Chorus:
.        Em                  D
   Take me into the holy of holies
.         C           D           Em  CD
   Take me in by the blood of the lamb
.           Em                D
   Take me into the holy of holies
.            C               D            Em
   Take the coal, touch my lips, here I am</lyrics>
