.D      G         D         G
 Lately I've been thinkin' about You
.    D      G         D        G
 And lately I've been dreamin' of You
.    D      G       D       A         G
 And lately I can't get You out of my head,
.        A         G
 Get You out of my head.

[C1]
.  D         Em
   Somethin' about the ocean
.  G        A
   Makes me rise up and praise.
.  D         Em
   Somethin' about the heavens
.  G        A
   Makes me stand in awe again.
.  D         Em
   Somethin' about the sunrise
.  G          A
   Reminds me of your faithfulness.
.  D         Em
   Somethin' about the ocean
.  G       A                  D
   And I'm lost in love again.

[V2]
.D          G     D       G
 I'll sing 'til I sense a smile
. D        G         D      G
 Upon Your great and lovely face
.     D     G         D       A       G
 And 'til I know Your glory's in this place
.             A       G
 Your glory's in this place.</lyrics>
