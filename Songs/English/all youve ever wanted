.E         F#m
 I just looked up today
. D        A     E
 And realized how far away I am
.   F#m    D  A
 From where You are
.E           F#m
 You gave me life worth dying for
. D          A
 But between the altar and the door
.  E           F#m
 I bought the lies that promised more
. D      A     E
 And here I go again

[V2]
.   F#m      D A  E
 oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh
.   F#m      D A
 oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh

[V3]
.E        F#m
 Lord I know I let you down
. D        A
 But somehow I will make You proud
.     E           F#m
 I'll turn this sinking ship around
. D         A
 And make it back to You

[V4]
.E           F#m
 But all my deeds and my good name
.     D          A
 Are just dirty rags that tear and strain
. E       F#m
 To cover all my guilty stains
.      D         A
 That you've already washed away

[V5]
.    E         F#m
 'Cause all You've ever wanted
.D         A
 All You've ever wanted
.E         F#m       D   A
 All You've ever wanted was my heart
.E         F#m
 Freedom's arms are open
. D           A
 My chains have all been broken
. E          F#m           D
 Relentless love has called me from the start
.D             E   F#m  D  A
 And all You wanted was m__y heart

[V6]
.   E              F#m
 I was chasing healing when I'd been made well
.   D                A
 I was fighting battles when You conquered hell
.E             F#m
 Living free but from a prison cell
.  D            A
 Lord, I lay that down today

[V7]
.E                  F#m
 So I'll stop living off of how I feel
. D              A
 And start standing on Your truth revealed
.E       F#m
 Jesus is my strength, my shield
.  D       A
 And He will never fail me

[V8]
.    E         F#m
 'Cause all You've ever wanted
.D         A
 All You've ever wanted
.E         F#m       D   A
 All You've ever wanted was my heart
.E         F#m
 Freedom's arms are open
. D           A
 My chains have all been broken
. E          F#m           D
 Relentless love has called me from the start
.D             E    F#m  E
 And all You wanted was my heart

[V9]
.E                F#m   D
 No more chains, I've been set free
.E                       F#m  D E
 No more fighting battles You have won for me
.E              F#m   D  E
 Now in Christ I stand complete
