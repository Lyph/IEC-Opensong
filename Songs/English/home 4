<lyrics>[V1]
 I will wait for You, I will wait for You
 Knowing that You will draw near to me

[V2]
 I was made for You, I was made for You
 I was made to be in Your presence

[V3]
 Here, oh Lord, I have made a place
 For You to fill, so come and have Your way

[V4]
 You're the one I want, You're the one I want
 You're the one my heart cries out for

[V5]
 This is not my home, This is not my home
 This is only temporary

[V6]
 But You oh Lord, will never fade away
 I'll be home when I see Your face

[V7]
 Now I've found my place in Your house</lyrics>
