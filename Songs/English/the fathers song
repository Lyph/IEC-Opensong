.Eb              Eb/D
 I have heard so many songs,
.Eb/Db         Ab2/C
 Listened to a thousand tongues,
.    Fm9               Bbs               Cm   Bb/D Ab
 But there is one that sounds above them all:
.Eb                     Eb/D
 The Father's song, the father's love.
.Eb/Db            Ab2/C      Fm9
 You sung it over , and for eternity
.    Bbs         Bb Eb
 It's written on my heart.

[C1]
.                   Ab/C
   Heaven's perfect melody
.  Bb/D    Eb/G
   The Creator's symphony ;
.  Ab2     Eb/G Fm7
   You are sin__ging over me
.  Bbs          Bb    Cm
   The Father's song.
.  Bb/D        Eb/G
   Heaven's perfect mystery:
.  Ab/C             Bb/D
   The King of love has sent for me.
.  Eb/G           Ab2  Eb/G
   And now You're sin__ging over me
.  Fm7   Bbs    Bb
   The Father's song.</lyrics>
