<lyrics>[V1]
 I stand accused, there's a list a mile long
 Of all my sins, of everything that I've done wrong
 I'm so ashamed, there's nowhere left for me to hide
 This is the day, I must answer for my life

[P1]
   My fate is in the Judges hands,
   But then he turns to me and says

[C1]
   I know you, I love you
   I gave my life, to save you
   Love paid the price for mercy
   My verdict, not guilty

[V2]
 Verse 2:
 How can it be, I cannot begin to comprehend
 What kind of Grace would take the place for all my sins
 I stand in awe, now that I have been set free
 And the tears well up, as I look at that Cross
 'Cause it should've been me

[P2]
   My fate was in the nail scarred hands,
   He stretched them out for me and said...

[B1]
   I'm falling on my knees to thank You
   With everything I am, I praise You
   So grateful for the words I heard you say</lyrics>
