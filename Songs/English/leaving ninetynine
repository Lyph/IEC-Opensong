.C          Am           Em             G
 I'm lost and broken, all alone on this road.
.C             Am               Em           G
 The wheels keep turnin', but the feelin' is gone.
.         F      C     G
 When I fear I'm on my own,
.Am            F      C    G
 You remind me I am not alone when You said,

[C1]
.             C                       Am
   &quot;I'd leave ninety-nine, leave them all behind,
.       Em      F          G
   to find you, for you alone.
.            C                       Am
   I'd leave ninety-nine, leave them all behind,
.       Em     F  G
   to find you.&quot;__

[V2]
.C           Am             Em            G
 It's dark and lonely and the path is unclear.
.C             Am               Em          G
 Can't move my feet because I'm frozen in fear.
.         F             C         G
 Then you say, &quot;My child, my child -
.  Am        F           C       G
 I am always here, I'm by your side.&quot;

[B1]
.  F                    G
   You're never too far down;
.                      Em
   I promise you'll be found.
.                       Am     G
   I'll reach into the mud and mire and clay,
.  F                  G
   pursue you to the end
.                      Em
   like a faithful friend.
.                     G                C  AmEmGCAmEm
   Nothing in this world can keep me away.</lyrics>
