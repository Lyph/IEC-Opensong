 'Twas on that dark, that doleful night When pow'rs of earth and hell arose Against the Son of God's delight, And friends betrayed Him to His foes:

[V2]
 Before the mournful scene began, He took the bread, and blessed, and brake: What love through all His actions ran! What wondrous words of grace He spake!

[V3]
 &quot;This is My body, broke for sin; Receive and eat the living food:&quot; Then took the cup, and blessed the wine; &quot;'Tis the new cov'nant in My blood.&quot;

[V4]
 For us His flesh with nails was torn, He bore the scourge, He felt the thorn; And justice poured upon His head Its heavy vengeance in our stead.

[V5]
 For us His vital blood was spilt, To buy the pardon of our guilt, When, for black crimes of biggest size, He gave His soul a sacrifice.

[V6]
 &quot;Do this,&quot; He cried, &quot;till time shall end,
 In memory of your dying friend;
 Meet at My table, and record
 The love of your departed Lord.&quot;

[V7]
 Jesus, Thy feast we celebrate,
 We show Thy death, we sing Thy name,
 Till Thou return, and we shall eat
 The marriage supper of the Lamb.</lyrics>
