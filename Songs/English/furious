<lyrics>[V1]
 Nothing can tear us from
 The grip of His mighty love
 We've only glimpsed His vast affection
 Heard whispers of His heart and passion
 It's pouring down

[V2]
 His love is deep, His love is wide and it covers us
 His love is fierce, His love is strong, it is furious
 His love is sweet, His love is wild
 And it's waking hearts to life

[V3]
 The Father loves and sends His son

[V4]
 The Son lays down His life for all
 He lavishes His love upon us
 He calls us now, His sons and daughters

[V5]
 He's reaching out
 And it's waking hearts to life
 He is waking hearts to life</lyrics>
