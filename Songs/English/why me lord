<lyrics>[V1]
 Why me, Lord what have I ever done
 To deserve even one of the pleasures I've known
 Tell me, Lord what did I ever do
 That was worth loving You or the kindness You've shown

[C1]
   Lord, help me, Jesus i've wasted it so
   Help me, Jesus i know what I am
   Now that I know that I've needed You
   So help me, Jesus my soul's in Your hands

[V2]
 Try me, Lord if You think there's a way
 I could ever repay all I've taken from You
 Maybe, Lord I can show someone else
 What I've been through myself on my way back to You</lyrics>
