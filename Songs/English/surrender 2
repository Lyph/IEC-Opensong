 All that I am is Yours
 All that I have is Yours
 I give You my heart and soul
 Lord I'm Yours

[V2]
 Lord every day is Yours
 Lord every breath is Yours
 Giving my life to You
 Lord I'm Yours

[P1]
   You alone are worthy of all praise
   You alone are worthy of all praise

[C1]
   I surrender all to You
   I surrender all to You
   I am nothing without You
   Jesus Christ take my life
   It's all for You

[V3]
 You're worthy of all praise
 You're worthy of all praise, Jesus</lyrics>
