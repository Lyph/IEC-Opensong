<lyrics>[V1]
 Every new day Your glory unfolds
 Filling my eyes with Your treasures untold
 The beauty of holiness brings worship anew
 My greatest love is You

[V2]
 Call me deeper into Your grace
 The river that flows from the Holy Place
 Wash over me, cleansing me through
 My greatest love is You

[V3]
 Wash over me, cleansing me through
 My greatest love is You
 Wash over me, cleansing me through
 My greatest love is You</lyrics>
