<lyrics>[V1]
 Zacchaeus was a wee little man,
 and a wee little man was he.
 He climbed up in a sycamore tree
 For the Lord he wanted to see.

[V2]
 And when the Savior passed that way
 He looked up in the tree.
 And said, 'Zacchaeus, you come down!
 For I'm going to your house today!
 For I'm going to your house today!'

[V3]
 Zacchaeus was a wee little man,
 But a happy man was he,
 For he had seen the Lord that day
 And a happy man was he;
 And a very happy man was he.</lyrics>
