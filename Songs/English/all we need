.         G                      D/F#
   'Cause we have all we need in You,
.                     Em7
   And all we need is You;
.                 C/G
   All we need is You. (2X)

[V1]
.G                             D/F#
 Rich or poor, God, I want You more
.                                    Em7
 Than anything that glitters in this world;
.                         C
 Be my all, all consuming fire.
.    G                             D/F#
 And You can have all my hands can hold,
.                                  Em7
 My heart, mind, and strength, and soul;
.                         C
 Be my all, all consuming fire.

.  Em           Am
   He's all we need.
.  Em           Am
   He's all we need
.  Em                    C
   'Cause You're all we need.
   All we need, all we need.

   All we need, all we need, all we need is You.</lyrics>
