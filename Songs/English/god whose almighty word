<lyrics>[V1]
 God, whose almighty word Chaos and darkness heard And took their flight: Hear us, we humble pray, And where the Gospel day Sheds not its glorious ray, Let there be light!

[V2]
 Lord, who once came to bring, On your redeeming wing, Healing and sight, Health to the sick in mind, Sight to the inly blind: Oh, now to humankind Let there be light!

[V3]
 Spirit of truth and love, Life giving, holy dove, Speed forth your flight; Move on the water's face, Bearing the lamp of grace, And in earth's darkest place Let there be light!

[V4]
 Holy and blessed three, Glorious Trinity, Wisdom, love, might! Boundless as ocean's tide, Rolling in fullest pride, Through the earth, far and wide, Let there be light!</lyrics>
