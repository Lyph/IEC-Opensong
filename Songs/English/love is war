 Verse: 1
.A     Hm           G   A   Hm          G
  In Your justice and Your mercy, Heaven walked the broken road
.A     Hm              G   A      Hm           G
  Here to fight this sinner's battle, here to make my fall Your own

[C1]
   Pre Chorus:
.  Hm              G           D      A
   Turn my eyes to see Your face as all my fears surrender
.  Hm             G                 D  A
   Hold my heart within this grace where burden turns to wonder

[C2]
   Chorus:
.        Hm          G      D        A
   I will fight to follow, I will fight for love
.        Hm       G       D         A
   To throw my life forever, into the triumph of the Son

[V2]
 Verse: 2
 Let Your love be my companion, in the war against my pride
 Long to break all vain obsession, till You're all that I desire

[B1]
   Bridge:
.        G      Hm           A          Em
   And I know Your love has won it all, You took the fall to embrace my sorrows
.  G       D           A             Em
    I know You took the fight, You came and died, but the grave was borrowed
.  G       Hm        A            Em
    I know You stood again, so I can stand with a life to follow
.  G      D         A
    In the light of Your name
