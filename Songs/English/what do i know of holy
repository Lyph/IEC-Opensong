<lyrics>[V1]
.Am                    Em
 I made You promises a thousand times.
.Am
 I tried to hear from heaven,
.Em
 But I talked the whole time.
.Am                     C
 I think I made You too small,
.Am                    C    G
 I never feared You at all, no.

[P1]
.         Am
   If you touched my face,
.          G
   would I know You?
.           Am
   Looked into my eyes,
.            G
   could I behold You?

[C1]
.  Am
   What do I know of You,
.      C             G
   who spoke me into motion?
.  F
   Where have I even stood
.           C               G
   But the shore along Your ocean?
.          Am            F
   Are You fire? Are You fury?
.          Am              F     G
   Are You sacred? Are You beautiful?
.     Am
   So what do I know,
.  F                 Am   FCG
   What do I know of holy?

[V2]
.Am                           Em
 I guess I thought that I had figured You out.
.Am                    Em
 I knew all the stories and I learned to talk about
.Am                     C
 How you were mighty to save,
.Am                        C          G
 But those were only empty words on a page.

[P2]
.         Am                          G
   Then I caught a glimpse of who You might be.
.                Am                     G
   The slightest hint of You brought me down to my knees.

[B1]
.                    Am
   What do I know of holy?
.                    Em                       F
   What do I know of wounds that will heal my shame
.        F            G        F
   and a God who gave life its name?
.                    Am
   What do I know of holy,
.         Em                 F
   Of the One who the angels praise?
.          F    G          F
   All creation knows Your name.
.               Am      G
   On earth and heaven above,
.            Am           F
   What do I know of this love?</lyrics>
