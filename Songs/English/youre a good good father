<lyrics>[V1]
 Oh, I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like
 But I've heard the tender whispers of love in the dead of night
 And you tell me that you're pleased
 And that I'm never alone

[C1]
   You're a Good, Good Father
   It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are
   And I'm loved by you
   It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am

[V2]
 Oh, and I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
 But I know we're all searching
 For answers only you provide
 'Cause you know just what we need
 Before we say a word

[B1]
   You are perfect in all of your ways
   You are perfect in all of your ways
   You are perfect in all of your ways to us

[B2]
   Oh, it's love so undeniable
   I, I can hardly speak
   Peace so unexplainable
   I, I can hardly think

[V3]
 As you call me deeper still [3x]
 Into love, love, love</lyrics>
