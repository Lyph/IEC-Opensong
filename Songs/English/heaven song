<lyrics>[V1]
.     Em                    D/F#        G
 You wrote a letter and You signed Your name
.Em          D/F#         G       C
 I read ever word Read it page by page
.    Em
 You said that You'd be coming
.       D/F#   G
 Coming for me soon
.Em    D/F#        C         G
 Oh my God I'll be ready for You

[C1]
.                     C              G
   ('Cause) I want to run on greener pastures
.            D               Em
   I want to dance on higher hills
.            C                  G
   I want to drink from sweeter waters
.         D             Em
   In the misty morning chill
.         C               G
   And my soul is getting restless
.          D             Em
   For the place where I belong
.          C                G          D
   I can't wait to join the angels and sing my heaven song

[V2]
.  Em                    D/F#     G
 I hear Your voice and I catch my breath
.Em           D/F#        G      C
 Well done my child enter in and rest
.   Em           D/F#         G
 As tears of joy roll down my cheek
.        Em        D/F#      C       G
 Oh it's beautiful beyond my wildest dreams</lyrics>
