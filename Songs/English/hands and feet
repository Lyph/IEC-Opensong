<lyrics>[V1]
.Bm                             G
 An image flashed across my TV screen.
.      Bm                         G
 Another broken heart comes into view.
.Bm                      G
 I saw the pain, and I turned my back.
.      D                          G
 Why can't I do the things I want to?
.A                     Em             A
 I am willing, yet I'm so afraid; You give me strength when I say...

[C1]
.  D                                             D/A
   I want to be Your hands. I want to be Your feet.
.  D/Em                                      D/G
   I'll go where You send me, go where You send me.
.  D                                             D/A
   I want to be Your hands, I want to be Your feet.
.  D/Em                                      D/G
   I'll go where You send me, go where You send me
.  Em              A           D                            A    G
   And I'll try, yeah I'll try to touch the world, like You touched my life,
.        Em             A
   And I'll find my way to be Your hands.

[V2]
.Bm                       G                  Bm                         G
 I've abandoned every selfish thought; I've surrendered everything I've got.
.Bm                      G         D                         G
 You can have everything I am and perfect everything I'm not.
.A                     Em         A
 I am willing, I'm not afraid. You give me strength when I say

[B1]
.  A                              G
   This is the last time I turn my back from You.
.  E                                       G
   From now on I'll go out, send me where You want me to.
.  A                                   G
   I finally have a mission, I promise I'll complete.
.  E                                          G
   I don't need excuses when I am your hands and feet.</lyrics>
