<lyrics>[V1]
 Caught in the half-light,
 I'm caught alone,
 Waking up to the sunrise
 and the radio.
 Feels like I'm tied up. What's holding me?
 Just praying today will be the day I go free.

[C1]
   And I want to live
   like there's no tomorrow.
   I want to dance like no one's around.
   I want to sing like nobody's listening
   Before I lay my body down.
   I want to give like I have plenty.
   I want to love like I'm not afraid.
   I want to be the man
   I was meant to be.
   I want to be the way I was made.

[V2]
 Made in Your likeness.
 Made with Your hands.
 Made to discover who You are
 and who I am.
 All I've forgotten,
 help me to find.
 All that You've promised,
 let it be in my life.</lyrics>
