 Intro:

[V2]
 Verse 1:
.D#m            C#            H
 Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me.
.D#m         C#         H
 You have been so, so good to me.
.D#m            C#              H
 Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me.
.D#m         C#         H
 You have been so, so kind to me.

[C1]
   Chorus:
.      D#m      C#        H        F#
   Oh the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
.      D#m         C#               H           F#
   Oh, it chases me down, fights 'till I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine.
.         D#m            C#              H          F#
   I couldn't earn it. I don't deserve it. Still, You give yourself away.
.      D#m      C#        H        F#
   Oh the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

[V3]
 Verse 2:
.D#m          C#              H
 When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me.
.D#m         C#         H
 You have been so, so good to me.
.D#m           C#          H
 When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me.
.D#m         C#         H
 You have been so, so kind to me.

[B1]
   Bridge:
.  D#m
   There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, coming after me.
.  D#m
   There's no wall You won't kick down, no lie You won't tear down, coming after me.

[V4]
.D#m               C#                 H           F#
 There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, coming after me.
.D#m               C#               H             F#
 There's no wall You won't kick down, no lie You won't tear down, coming after me.
.D#m               C#                 H           F#
 There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, coming after me.
.D#m               C#               H             F#
 There's no wall You won't kick down, no lie You won't tear down, coming after me.</lyrics>
