.Em                                Cmaj7
 Take me past the outer courts and thru the holy place,
.D                              Em               Cmaj7
 Past the brazen altar; Lord, I want to see Your face;
.D
  
.Em                                       Cmaj7
 Pass me by the crowds of people, and the priests who sing their praise;
.  D
 I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness,
.        Am7            Cmaj7 D
 But its only found one place.

[C1]
.             Em                D/E
   So take me in to the Holy of Holies,
.          Am7       Am7/D        Em   Cmaj7D
   Take me in by the blood of the Lamb;
.             Em                D/E
   So take me in to the Holy of Holies,
.           Am7   Am7/D      D            Em
   Take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am.</lyrics>
