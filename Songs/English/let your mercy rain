<lyrics>[V1]
 God, You have done great things.
 God, You give grace to the weak
 And bless the brokenhearted
 With a song of praise to sing.

[P1]
   You reached down and lifted us up.
   You came running looking for us.
   And now there's nothing
   And no one beyond Your love.

[C1]
   You're the overflow,
   You're the fountain of my heart.
   Let Your mercy rain,
   Let Your mercy rain on us.

[C2]
   You're the faithful one
   When the world's falling apart.
   Let Your mercy rain,
   Let Your mercy rain on us.

[B1]
   How deep, how wide, how long,
   how high is Your love, is Your love.
   How deep, how wide, how long,
   How high is Your love,
   Is Your love, oh God.

[B2]
   Let it rain.</lyrics>
