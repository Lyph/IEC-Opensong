.Em            C
 The father of lies,
.Em        C                    Em
 Coming to steal, kill, and destroy
.      C                        Em
 All my hopes of being good enough.

[P1]
.                      C                              D
   I hear him saying, &quot;Cursed are the ones who can't abide.&quot;
.       C          D          C
   He's right. Alleluia. He's right.

[C1]
.  C        D             C                  D      C
   The devil is preaching  the song of the redeemed,
.           D                  G       A      Bm   A  G
   That I am cursed and gone astray, I cannot gain salvation.
.                       Em
   Embracing accusation.

[V2]
 Could the father of lies
 Be telling the truth of God to me tonight?
 If the penalty of sin is death, then death is mine.

[C2]
.  C        D            C
   The devil is preaching
.  C                  D     C
   The song of the redeemed,
.  C       D                    G
   That I am cursed and gone astray,
.    A      Bm   A  G Bm A Bm     AGBmABmAG
   I cannot gain saaaaaalvvvation.
.      
       

[B1]
.  G      Bm              A          Bm  A   G
   Oh the devil's singing over me an age old song,
.  G         Bm              A Bm A G
   That I am cursed and gone astray.
.  G           Bm                 A        Bm A G
   Singing the first verse so conveniently over me,
.  G    Bm            A
   He's forgotten the refrain...
.         G Bm ABmAG(repeat)
   JESUS SAVES!</lyrics>
