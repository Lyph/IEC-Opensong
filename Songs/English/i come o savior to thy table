<lyrics>[V1]
 I come, O Savior, to Thy table, For weak and weary is my soul; Thou, Bread of Life, alone art able To satisfy and make me whole: Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood Be for my soul the highest good!

[V2]
 Oh, grant that I in manner worthy May now approach Thy heav'nly board And, as I lowly bow before Thee, Look only unto Thee, O Lord! Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood Be for my soul the highest good!

[V3]
 Unworthy though I am, O Savior, Because I have a sinful heart, Yet Thou Thy lamb wilt banish never, For Thou my faithful Shepherd art: Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood Be for my soul the highest good!

[V4]
 Oh, let me loathe all sin forever As death and poison to my soul That I through willful sinning never May see Thy judgment take its toll! Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood Be for my soul the highest good!

[V5]
 Thy heart is filled with fervent yearning That sinners may salvation see Who, Lord, to Thee in faith are turning; So I, a sinner, come to Thee. Lord, may Thy body and Thy blood Be for my soul the highest good!

[V6]
 Weary am I and heavy laden,
 With sin my soul is sore opprest;
 Receive me graciously and gladden
 My heart, for I am now Thy guest.

[V7]
 Thou here wilt find a heart most lowly
 That humbly falls before Thy feet,
 That duly weeps o'er sin, yet solely
 Thy merit pleads, as it is meet.

[V8]
 By faith I call Thy holy table
 The testament of Thy deep love;
 For, lo, thereby I now am able
 To see how love Thy heart doth move.

[V9]
 What higher gift can we inherit?
 It is faith's bond and solid base;
 It is the strength of heart and spirit,
 The covenant of hope and grace.

[V10]
 This feast is manna, wealth abounding
 Unto the poor, to weak ones power,
 To angels joy, to hell confounding,
 And life for me in death's dark hour.

[V11]
 Thy body, giv'n for me, O Savior,
 Thy blood which Thou for me didst shed,
 These are my life and strength forever,
 By them my hungry soul is fed.

[V12]
 With Thee, Lord, I am now united;
 I live in Thee and Thou in me.
 No sorrow fills my soul, delighted
 It finds its only joy in Thee.

[V13]
 Who can condemn me now? For surely
 The Lord is nigh, who justifies.
 No hell I fear, and thus securely
 With Jesus I to Heaven rise.

[V14]
 Though death may threaten with disaster,
 It cannot rob me of my cheer;
 For He Who is of death the Master,
 With aid and comfort e'er is near.

[V15]
 My heart has now become Thy dwelling, O bless√®d, holy Trinity.
 With angels I, Thy praises telling, Shall live in joy eternally.</lyrics>
