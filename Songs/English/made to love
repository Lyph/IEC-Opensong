<lyrics>[V1]
 The dream is fading, now I'm staring at the door
 I know its over cause my feet have hit the cold floor
 Check my reflection, I ain't feelin what I see
 It's no mystery.
 Whatever happened to a passion I could live for
 What became of the flame that made me feel more
 And when did I forget that?

[C1]
   I was made to love You I was made to find You
   I was made just for You Made to adore You
   I was made to love And be loved by You
   You were here before me You were waiting on me
   And You said you'd keep me
   Never would You leave me I was made to love and be loved by You.

[V2]
 The dream's alive with my eyes opened wide
 Back in the ring You've got me swinging for the grand prize
 I feel the haters spitting vapors on my dreams
 But I still believe
 I'm reaching out, reaching up, reaching over
 I feel a breeze cover me called Jehovah
 And Daddy I'm on my way Cause I was made to love...

[V3]
 Was made to love You
 I was made to find You
 I was made just for You
 Made to adore You
 I was made to love
 And be loved by You
 You were here before me
 You were waiting on me
 And You said you'd keep me
 Never would You leave me I was made to love and be loved by You.

[B1]
   Anything I would give up for You
   Everything, I'd give it all away.
   Anything I would give up for You
   Everything, I'd give it, I'd give it all away, Oh yeah!

[V4]
 Cause I was made to love You (I was made to love You)
 Yeah I was made to love You (I was made to find You)
 Cause I was made to love You (I was made to adore You, made just for You)
 I was made to love You (I was made to adore You, made just for You)</lyrics>
