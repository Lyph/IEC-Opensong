 Verse 1:
.       F    C         G          Am
 You've overcome this world with love
.    F        C          G Am
 And made my fight Your own
.   F      C               G    Am
 I lift my eyes and throw fear aside
.     F        C        G   Am
 And sing out into the night

   Chorus:
.                      F      C
   Cause even when the world caves
.                G     Am
   Even when the fight calls
.                F      C
   Even when the war's waged
.             G   Am
   I'll take heart
.                 F   C
   I know You are greater
.                 G   Am
   Forever You are Savior
.              F     C
   I will sing Your praise
.            G
   With all that I have
.  Am                  F
   With all that I am Lord

 Verse 2:
.           F        C                G       Am
 I'll stare down the waves cause You own the tide
.  F        C         G  Am
 I still my soul and know
.   F         C      G      Am
 You wait for me on waters wild
.       F          C          G
 Where faith walks above the storm

.    F                    C
   I won't let the storm weather my heart
.  G             Am
   Won't let the darkness beat me down
.  F                 C                 G Am
   Sing in the night my hope alive in You
.       F                      C
   I'll walk through the fire and not be burned
.  G                  Am
   Pray in the fight and watch it turn
.  F             C                 G  Am
   Jesus tonight I give it all to You
