[V2]
 VERSE 1
 I could chase after greatness
 First to fall on my knees
 Lose myself to be found
 Where You want me
 I could do all the right things
 Sing the words till they bleed
 But I know it's just noise
 If I don't have love

[V3]
 CHORUS
 So I won't waste my breath
 If it's not for love
 I don't have the heart
 If it's not for love
 Don't let me say it's faith
 If it counts no cost
 'Cause there's no fear in love
 But there is a cross

[V4]
 VERSE 2
 I could speak like the angels
 Prophesy knowing all
 I could live with the faith
 To move mountains
 Should I die like a martyr
 Give my wealth to the poor
 It would all scream loud-nothing
 If I don't have love

[V5]
 BRIDGE
 Be patient
 Be kind
 Hold no envy or pride
 Be the first to come last
 For another
 Never forced
 Slow to anger
 Trust without keeping score
 Long to suffer with truth
 Love will never die

[V6]
 TAG
 Love will never die
 But there is a cross</lyrics>
