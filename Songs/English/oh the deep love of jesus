 1 verse:
.F#m    C#   F#m    C#   F#m
 O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
.A       F#m      Hm    C#     F#m
 Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free,
.F#m        C#     F#m
 Rolling as a mighty ocean
.A     F#m      Hm   C# F#m
 In its fullness over me.

.A      E      F#m      C7
 Underneath me, all around me,
.F#m     E       D      C7
 Is the current of Thy love;
.F#m      C#  F#m    C#    F#m
 Leading onw__ard, leading homeward
.A   E F#m   D   Hm   C7 F#m
 To my glorious rest above.

 2 verse:
 O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
 Spread His praise from shore to shore!
 How He loveth, ever loveth,
 Changeth never, nevermore!
 How He watcheth o'er His loved ones,
 Died to call them all His own;
 How for them He intercedeth,
 Watcheth o'er them from the throne.

[V4]
 3 verse:
 O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
 Love of ev'ry love the best;
 'tis an ocean vast of blessing,
 'tis a haven sweet of rest.
 O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
 'tis heav'n of heav'ns to me;
 And it lifts me up to glory,
 For it lifts me up to Thee.</lyrics>
