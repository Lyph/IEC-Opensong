 We have come, as one heart
 As one voice, to join Heaven's
 Endless song on the earth
 Lifting up our adoration
 Towards Your throne, praises rise
 Songs of love are now ascending
 For the King, for the Lamb
 Who gave His life to save us

[V2]
 Holy, Holy, Holy
 All of Heaven cries
 Worthy, Worthy, Worthy
 For You were crucified
 living creatures call out
 all the elders fall down

[V3]
 A sacrifice of living praise
 We bring our all for You have beckoned
 Us into a holy place
 A holy love, Your very presence
 now we stand wondrous awe
 A glory cry we raise to Heaven
 With holy hands and lifted hearts

[V4]
 eyes upon our Savior

[V5]
 Holy, Holy, Holy
 All of Heaven cries
 Worthy, Worthy, Worthy
 For You were crucified
 living creatures call out
 all the elders fall down

[V6]
 fall down and worship
 worship, we worship

[V7]
 Holy, Holy, God most Holy
 Worthy to receive all glory
 Heaven's shouting as we glorify</lyrics>
