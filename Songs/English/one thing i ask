 That I may dwell in Your house, oh Lord.

 All of my days, all of my life,
.C          Dsus D    G
 That I may see  You, Lord.

 Hear me, oh Lord, hear me when I cry.
 Lord, do not hide Your face from me.
 You have been my strength,
 You have been my shield,
 And You will lift me up.</lyrics>
