<title>I stand upon the solid rock of faith in Christ</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 I stand upon the solid rock of faith in Christ
 This steadfast hope shall not break apart within the trial
 I am assured His promises will never fail
 As long as life remains, He is faithful

[C1]
   God is patient, God is kind
   He does not envy, He does not boast
   His ways are higher than my own
   His thoughts consume the great unknown
   Of this alone I am sure, my God is love

[V2]
 I draw my breath under His created windswept sky
 I know my hope shall last long after my flesh retires
 From dusk until the dawn He calls His children home
 His righteous love outlasts generations

[B1]
   He is Almighty God, Elohim
   Maker of the earth
   He is the Lord of hosts, heaven's King
   God of endless worth
   His kingdom stands above every power
   Every living soul
   His love is like the sun, ever true
   Shining over all</lyrics>
