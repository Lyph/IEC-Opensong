 Verse: 1
.E                            G#m
 All the bitter weary ways endless striving day by day
.    C#m                               A
 You barely have the strength to pray in the valley low
.E                         G#m
 How hard your fight has been how deep the pain within
.C#m                               A
 Wounds that no one else has seen hurts too much to show

[C1]
   Pre chorus:
.  E                                     G#m
   All the doubt you're standing in between
.  C#m                                           A
   And all the weight that brings you to your knees

[C2]
   Chorus:
.       E        G#m
   He knows  He knows
.        C#m                          A
   Every hurt and every sting He has walked the suffering
.       E         G#m
   He knows  He knows
.          C#m                            A
   Let your burdens come undone lift your eyes up to the one

[V2]
 Verse: 2
.E                                  G#m
 We may faint and we may sink feel the pain and near the brink
.C#m                                      A
 But the dark begins to shrink when you find the one who knows

[C3]
   Pre chorus:
.  E                                      G#m
   The chains of doubt that held you in between
.  C#m                                A
   One by one are starting to break free

[B1]
   Bridge:
.  H
   Every time that you feel forsaken
.  C#m                   A
   Every time that you feel alone
.  H
   He is near to the broken hearted
.  C#m    H  A
   Every tear</lyrics>
