 Jesus Jesus hope and joy
 In the baby boy
 Come to love and come to free us
 All the world
 Every boy and girl
 All are singing

 (Christ is born oh Christ is born)

 Jesus Jesus Virgin child
 Tender, meak and mild
 Come to give us sight
 And help us love each other
 Stranger and a brother
 All are singing

 (Christ is born oh Christ is born)
 Beat a heart new hope within us
 (-\\-)
 Oh, rejoice for God is with us

[V5]
 glory glory in the highest
 glory glory in the highest
 glory glory in the highest
 (Christ is born oh Christ is born)
