<lyrics>[V1]
 Lord, who throughout these forty days For us didst fast and pray, Teach us with Thee to mourn our sins And close by Thee to stay.

[V2]
 As Thou with Satan didst contend, And didst the vict'ry win, O give us strength in Thee to fight, In Thee to conquer sin.

[V3]
 As Thou didst hunger bear, and thirst, So teach us, gracious Lord, To die to self, and chiefly live By Thy most holy Word.

[V4]
 And through these days of penitence, And through Thy passiontide, Yea, evermore in life and death, Jesus, with us abide.

[V5]
 Abide with us, that so, this life Of suff'ring over past, An Easter of unending joy We may attain at last.</lyrics>
