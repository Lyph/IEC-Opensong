<title>Greater</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 From him, through him, and to him are all things
 To God be the glory
 His word endures from beginning to end
 To God be the glory
 To God be the glory

[V2]
 Greater is the one who lives in me
 Greater is the love of Jesus
 Greater than my sin
 Greater than the grave
 Above all other thrones
 Above all other names
 Greater, You are greater

[V3]
 He was, and is, and forever will be
 To God be the glory
 His power in us
 He is strength for the weak
 To God be the glory
 To God be the glory

[V4]
 Jesus, You reign forever
 Jesus, You reign forever
 There's no one like you
 Jesus, You reign
 Jesus, You reign forever
 Jesus, You reign forever
 There's none beside You</lyrics>
