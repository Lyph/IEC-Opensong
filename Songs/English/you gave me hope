<title>You gave me hope</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 You gave me hope,
 You made me whole at the cross
 You took my place, You showed me grace
 At the cross where You died for me

[C1]
   And His glory appears like the light from the sun
   Age to age He shines
   Look to the skies, hear the angels cry,
   Singing Holy is The Lord!</lyrics>
