 O rushing wind and breezes soft,
 O clouds that ride the winds aloft:
 Oh, praise Him! Alleluia!
 O rising morn, in praise rejoice,
 O lights of evening, find a voice.

 O flowing waters, pure and clear,
 Make music for your Lord to hear.
 Oh, praise Him! Alleluia!
 O fire so masterful and bright,
 Providing us with warmth and light,

 Let all things their Creator bless,
 And worship Him in humbleness,
 Oh, praise Him! Alleluia!
 Oh, praise the Father, praise the Son,
 And praise the Spirit, three in One!</lyrics>
