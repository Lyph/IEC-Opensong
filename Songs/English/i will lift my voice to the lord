 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will cry, I will cry
 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will cry, I will cry

 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will plead, I will plead
 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will plead

 I will pour out, pour out
 Pour out my complaint before him
 I will pour out, pour out
 Pour out my complaint before him

 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will cry, I will cry
 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will cry, I will cry

 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will plead, I will plead
 I will lift my voice to the Lord, I will plead

 I will pour out, pour out
 Pour out my complaint before him
 I will pour out, pour out
 Pour out my complaint before him

 I will tell of my woes before him
 I will tell of my woes before him

[V9]
 I will tell of my woes before him
 I will tell of my woes before him

 Praise, o my soul, Praise the Lord
 Praise, o my soul, Praise the Lord

[V11]
 Praise, o my soul, Praise the Lord
 Praise, o my soul, Praise the Lord</lyrics>
