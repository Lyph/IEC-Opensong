<lyrics>[V1]
 Verse 1
 You're always moving in the unseen
 The breath You exhale sustaining me
 Before I call, You know my need
 You're always going before me

[V2]
 Chorus
 I'm confident Your faithfulness will see me through
 My soul can rest, my righteousness is found in You
 With every moment left, in every borrowed breath
 Let this be true
 That all my heart, for all my life belongs to you

[V3]
 Verse 2
 Your laughter scatters my enemies
 You give me joy for my mourning
 You lift my head, so I can see
 All of Heaven surrounding me

[V4]
 Bridge
 I won't win this battle with the strength of my own hands
 You're the Mountain Mover, and only You can
 I won't build my life on sinking sand
 You're my hope forever, the Rock where I stand</lyrics>
