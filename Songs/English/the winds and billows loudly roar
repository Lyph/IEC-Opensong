<lyrics>[V1]
 The winds and billows loudly roar We flounder in the deep Our bark is frail, far off the shore, And Jesus is asleep.

[V2]
 &quot;Save us, we perish, Lord,&quot; they cry; To Thee we fly for aid; &quot;Awake! awake!&quot; they say; but why So faithless and afraid?

[V3]
 His head is pillow'd on the stern, As Man He is asleep; As God He all things does discern, And endless vigils keep.

[V4]
 He does the elements control; By His Almighty Will. The angry waves their surges roll; And at His Word are still.

[V5]
 O ye, who in the Church's Bark O'er life's rough ocean sail, When all around is drear and dark, and human efforts fail,</lyrics>
