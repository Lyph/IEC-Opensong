 King Of Glory

[V2]
 Who is this King of glory that persues me with His love
 And haunts me with each hearing of His softly spoken words
 My conscience, a reminder of forgiveness that I need
 Who is this King of glory who offers it to me

[V3]
 Who is this King of angels, O blessed Prince of Peace
 Revealing things of Heaven and all it's mysteries
 My spirit's ever longing for His greace in which to stand
 Who is this King of glory, Son of God and song of man

[C1]
   His name is Jesus, precious Jesus
   The Lord Almighty, the King of my heart, The King of glory

[V4]
 Who is this King of glory with strength and majesty
 And wisdom beyond measure, the gracious King of kings
 The Lord of Eath and Heaven, the Creator of all things
 Who is this King of glory, He's everything to me</lyrics>
