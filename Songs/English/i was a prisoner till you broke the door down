<lyrics>[V1]
 I was a prisoner, till You broke the door down
 You freed me, oh, You freed me
 I was in darkness, till You turned the lights on
 You found me, first, You found me

[V2]
 I was lifeless, till You laid Your life down
 You loved me, first, You loved me
 Yeah, I was joyless, till You put Your song in me
 Now I'm singing, always singing

[C1]
   You're all that I want, You're all that I've ever needed
   This unthinkable love poured out on me It's overwhelming

[V3]
 No longer broken, You picked up the pieces
 You healed me, oh, You healed me
 And I can't be quiet, Your Spirit is alive in me
 Now I'm singing, always singing

[C2]
   You're all that I want, You're all that I've ever needed
   This unthinkable love poured out on me It's overwhelming

[B1]
   I'm wide awake, wide awake in wonder
   I can't escape, can't escape Your great love
   I'm wide awake, wide awake in Your presence
   It's overwhelming, it's overwhelming

[C3]
   You're all that I want, all that I've ever needed
   This unthinkable love poured out on me It's overwhelming
   You're all that I want You're all that I've ever needed
   This unthinkable love poured out on me It's overwhelming

[V4]
 You take this heart of stone and make it beat again
 You take my dry bones and breathe Your life in
 You take this heart of stone and make it beat again
 You take my dry bones and breathe Your life in
 You take this heart of stone and make it beat again
 You take my dry bones and breathe Your life in
 It's overwhelming</lyrics>
