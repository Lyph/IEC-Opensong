 Follow the star to a place unexpected
 Would you believe, after all we've projected,
 A child in a manger?
 Lowly and small, the weakest of all
 Unlikeliest hero, wrapped in his mother's shawl -
 Just a child -
 Is this who we've waited for? 'cause...

[C1]
   How many kings step down from their thrones?
   How many lords have abandoned their homes?
   How many greats have become the least for me?
   And how many gods have poured out their hearts
   To romance a world that is torn all apart
   How many fathers gave up their sons for me?

[V2]
 Bringing our gifts for the newborn Savior
 All that we have, whether costly or meek
 Because we believe.
 Gold for his honor, and frankincense for his pleasure
 And myrrh for the cross he will suffer
 Do you believe?
 Is this who we've waited for?</lyrics>
