 Intro:

[V2]
 Verse: 1
.Em                  C
 I can hear the footsteps of my King
.G                  D
 I can hear his heartbeat beckoning
.Em                C
 In my darkness, He has set me free
.G                D
 Now I hear the spirit calling me, He's calling

[C1]
   Chorus:
.  Em          C
   Wake up child, It's our turn to shine
.     G             D
   We were born for such a time as this
.  Em          C
   Wake up child, It's our turn to shine
.     G             D

 Verse: 2
.Em             C
 I can hear a holy rumbling
.G                D
 I've begun to preach another King
.Em                    C
 Loosing chains and breaking down the walls
.  G                 D
 I want to hear the Father when he calls, He's calling
