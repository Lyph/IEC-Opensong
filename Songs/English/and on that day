<lyrics>[V1]
.    Em          Bm            Am            Em
     In a little corner of the world lived a maiden,
.        Bm             Am            D             Em
 Pure in heart, good in deed, full of grace, gentle rose;
.     G         D              Am            Em
 An angelic salutation for the Word's annunciation
.         G             D         Am     D   Em
 She's to be the chosen mother of Jesus, our Lord.

[V2]
.           Em              Bm             Am            Em
 And as she listened to the voice with her gaze upon the splendor
.       Bm              Am                D               Em
 Love embraced her open heart, and she conceived the holy Lord.
.   G        D           Am        Em
 &quot;Behold the handmaid, behold your servant,
.      G         D    Am      D       Em
 Be it done unto me according to Your word.&quot;

[V3]
.    Em          Bm               Am       Em
     In a little time there would be a celebration
.     Bm                Am             D             Em
 Elizabeth would bear a son, they will call his name John.
.        G             D         Am       Em
 He will go before the Lord as a faithful messenger
.         G        D           Am       D     Em
 He'll prepare the way for the Lamb who is to come.

[C1]
.              Am             G          C              D
   And on that day was put in motion the means of our redemption,
.        Am             G       C       D      Am
   And a way was opened up as a highway to our God;
.                          G          C            D
   And a child was born to us, and to us a Son was given,
.              Am                G             C        D       G
   Through the young and blessed Mary came the greatest Gift of all.

[B1]
.  G     D     Am     Em      G     D    Am D   Em
   Holy, holy, holy Redeemer, Holy, holy is the Lord;
.  G          D      Am       Em
   Blessed is He who comes to free us,
.          G         D            Am   D      Em
   Blessed is He who comes in the Name of the Lord.</lyrics>
