<lyrics>[V1]
 Lord You seem so far away
 A million miles or more it feels today
 And though I haven't lost my faith
 I must confess right now that it's hard for me to pray

[P1]
    Cause I don't know what to say
   And I don't know where to start
   But as You give the grace
   With all that's in my heart

[C1]
    I will sing I will pray
   Even in my darkest hour
   Through the sorrow and pain
   I will sing I will pray
   Lift my hands to honour You
   Because Your word is true

[V2]
  Lord it's hard for me to see
 All the thoughts and plans you have for me
 But I will put my trust in You
 Knowing that You died to set me free

[P2]
    But I don't know what to say
   And I don't know where to start
   But as You give the grace
   With all that's in my heart</lyrics>
