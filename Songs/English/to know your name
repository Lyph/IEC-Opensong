.Bm                    G              D
 The precious blood of Jesus Christ redeems,

 Forgiven, I'm alive, restored set free.

 Your majesty resides inside of me,
.            A                  Bm
 Forever I believe, forever I believe

.  D         A        Bm              G
   Know Your name, to live within the Savior's love

   And He took my place knowing He'd be crucified

   You loved, You loved, a people undeserving</lyrics>
