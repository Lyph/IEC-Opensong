<lyrics>[V1]
 // Lord, You've set your throne between the cherubim, cherubim  //
 And unto this heart of mine you are Light, O Lord
 Word, O Lord / Life, O Lord / Strength, O Lord
 The glory of your brightness is a path to me
 A path to me, the Way to me

[V2]
 You've spread your tent above me, O Lord
 Keep me secure, O my King
 By night, by day, I'll worship You, my Lord
 By night, by day, O Lord on high!</lyrics>
