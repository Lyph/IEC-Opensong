<lyrics>[V1]
 Let this be a place where You long to come
 As we make a way, for Your love
 Let these hands be clean and this heart be pure
 Blameless as the Bride, You're coming for

[C1]
   It's the power of Your presence that changes us
   Your glory all around us and we're undone
   You open up the Heavens and fall afresh on us

[V2]
 Let this be a house where You long to stay
 Every will You meet us, face to face
 Abandoned here before You we want nothing else
 Than just to be with You, and You alone

[C2]
   It's the power of Your presence that changes us
   Your glory all around us and we're undone
   You open up the Heavens and fall afresh on us

[V3]
 Fall afresh on us

[B1]
   Holy Spirit, fill this heart again
   Holy Spirit, burn like fire within
   Holy Spirit, fill this heart again
   Holy Spirit, burn like fire within
   Holy Spirit, fill this heart again
   Holy Spirit, burn like fire within

[C3]
   It's the power of Your presence that changes us
   Your glory all around us and we're undone
   You open up the Heavens and fall afresh on us

[V4]
 Fall afresh on us
 Fall afresh on us
 Fall afresh on us</lyrics>
