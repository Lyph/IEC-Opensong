 From the ends of the earth, (girls echo)

 From the depths of the sea, (girls echo)

 From the heights of the heavens, (girls echo)

 Your name be praised!

 From the cries of the weak, (girls echo)

 And the shouts of the strong, (girls echo)

 From the lips of all people, (girls echo)
.     A    B  A      B
 This song we raise, Lord!
