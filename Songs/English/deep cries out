.G
 I've got a river of
.G/B
 Living water
.  C
 A fountain that never will run dry
.     G            G/B
 It's open heavens You're releasing
.    C
 And we will never be denied

[P1]
.              G
   Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells,
.        G/B
   We're stirring up deep deep waters
.                 C
   We're going to dance in the river, dance in the river
.              G
   Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells,
.       G/B
   We're stirring up deep deep waters
.        C
   We're going to jump in the river,
   Jump in the river

[C1]
.  G
   Deep cries out to deep cries out to You,
.  Am7
   deep cries out to deep cries out to You
.  G/B                           C
   We cry out to, we cry out to, You Jesus

[B1]
.        G            Am7            G/B            C
   We're falling into deeper waters, calling out to You
.        G            G/B            C           Am7
   We're walking into deeper waters, going after You</lyrics>
