 There are days when I feel
 The best of me is ready to begin
 Then there's days when I feel
 I'm letting go and soaring on the wind

[P1]
   'Cause I've learned in laughter or in pain
   How to survive!

[C1]
   I get on my knees! I get on my knees!
   There I am before the Love that changes me
   See I don't know how but there's power
   When I'm on my knees

[V2]
 I can be in a crowd
 Or by myself and almost anywhere
 When I feel there's a need
 To talk with God He is Emmanuel

[P2]
   When I close my eyes, no darkness there
   There's only light!</lyrics>
