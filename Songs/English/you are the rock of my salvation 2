 You are the rock of my salvation,
 You are the strength of my life.
 You are my hope and my inspiration,
 Lord unto You will I cry.

[C1]
   I believe in you, believe in You,
   For Your faithful love to me.
   You have been my help in time of need;
   Lord, unto You will cleave.</lyrics>
