.   D            G/D D Asus  A
 Oh Lord, You're beautiful;__
.     D       G   D/F# Asus  A
 Your face is all I    see;__
.    Bm        F#/A#    Bm A/C# D
 And when Your eyes are on this child,
.     Em7    Asus   A  Dsus D
 Your grace abounds to me.

[V2]
.   D            G/D   D   Asus  A
 Oh Lord, please light the fire__
.     D           G      D/F# Asus A
 That once burned bright and  clear;
.  Bm        F#/A#   Bm A/C#  D
 Replace the lamp of my first love,
.     Em7        Asus A Dsus D
 That burns with holy fear.

[C1]
.            G    D/F# Em   D   A/C#     A    D
   I want to take Your Word and shine it all around,
.                    G       E/G#     Asus A
   But first help me just to live it, Lord;
.               G D/F# Em               A/C#         F#/A#
   And when I'm doing  well, help me to never seek a crown,
.           Bm             A        G2 D
   For my reward is giving glory to You.</lyrics>
