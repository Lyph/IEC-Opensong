.         F#m7                       D                   F#m7
 And if I told you that somebody did love you, would you say
.                  D
 &quot;Hey show me that face;&quot;
.         F#m7                           D                 F#m7
 And if I told you that true freedom was actual, would you say
.                      D
 &quot;Hey, take me to that place?&quot;
.       F#m7              D         F#m7               D
 And if I said there is a family: a body that moves as one;
.F#m7                              D
 Do you feel the love that invites us, the liberty excites us,
.    F#m7             D               G
 The disco has just begun, has just begun.

.          D                      G                   D                    G
   Give me love, give me liberty, disco: a place everybody in the family's found;
.               D                    G                       D              G
   On that day, we will all be happy people, when love, liberty, disco's in town.

[V2]
.          F#m7                       D                    F#m7                     D
 And as we step into the light of the Lover, we're all the same, there's no rich or poor;
.        F#m7                                   D
 And you know it's never been good for a man to be alone,
.           F#m7                   D                 G
 So come on in, your name's on the door, what are we waiting for?

[B1]
.  Bm       A                 G            F#m                 D
    All our fears are turning 'round, fall down, and meet your Maker,
.            A                   G              F#m                 D
   Where our true selves will be found, calling out to every lonely soul.</lyrics>
