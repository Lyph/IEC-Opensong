<title>Where There Is Faith</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
.G                                              C
 I believe in faithfulness, I believe in giving of myself,
.            G
 For someone else;
.G                                              C
 I believe in peace and love, I believe in honesty and trust,
.              G
 but it's not enough;
.    D                            G                 C
 For all that I believe may never change the way it is,
.       G               D
 unless I believe Jesus lives.

[C1]
.                 G                 C
   Where there is faith, there is a voice calling,
.   G             C           G            D
   &quot;Keep walking, you're not alone in this world;&quot;
.                 G                 C            G
   Where there is faith, there is a peace like a child sleeping
.  C        G          D
   hope everlasting in He
.                 G          C         Am         D          G
   Who is able to bear every burden to heal every hurt in my heart;
.          C          G        D                     G
   It is a wonderful, powerful place: where there is faith.

[V2]
.G                                                      C
 There's a man across the sea, never heard the sound of freedom ring,
.        G
 Only in his dreams;
.G                                                  C
 There's a lady dressed in black, in a motorcade of Cadillacs,
.            G
 Daddy's not coming back;
.        D                            G               C
 And our hearts begin to fall and our stability grows weak,
.          G                     D
 But Jesus meets our needs if we only believe.</lyrics>
