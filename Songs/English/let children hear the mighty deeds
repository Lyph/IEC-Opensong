<lyrics>[V1]
 Let children hear the mighty deeds Which God performed of old; Which in our younger years we saw, And which our fathers told.

[V2]
 He bids us make His glories known, His works of pow'r and grace; And we'll convey His wonders down Through every rising race.

[V3]
 Our lips shall tell them to our sons, And they again to theirs; That generations yet unborn May teach them to their heirs.

[V4]
 Thus shall they learn in God alone Their hope securely stands, That they may ne'er forget His work But practice His commands.</lyrics>
