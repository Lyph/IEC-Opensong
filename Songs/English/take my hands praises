<lyrics>[V1]
.C#m
 Take my hands, take my feet.
.C#m
 Take the music to the street.
.C#m
 Hear the prayers, feel the sound:
.  C#m                B
 A generation Kingdom bound.

[P1]

   Great and glorious! Is my Savior!

[C1]
.  A             E              C#m
   Praises on my tongue from my heart
.          B              A
   For our God who became flesh.
.         E         C#m
   For us all, unto You,

   I will sing Your praises, sing forever!

[V2]
.C#m
 Take my will, take my all.

 Wrap my life around Your call.
.C#m
 Set apart to sing Your praise,
.C#m                             B
 To live the difference in these days.

   Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing, to sing aloud, sing aloud!

   All, for the glory of my God and King!

   Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing!</lyrics>
