 Holy, Holy,
 Holy is the Lord God Almighty.
 Holy, Holy,
 Holy is the Lord God Almighty.
 Who was and is and is to come,
 Who was and is and is to come.

[V2]
 Lift up His name with the sound of singing,
 Lift up His name in all the earth.
 Lift up your voice and give Him glory,
 For He is worthy to be praised.</lyrics>
