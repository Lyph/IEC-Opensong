<lyrics>[V1]
 Shame is a prison, as cruel as the grave
 Shame is a robber, and he's come to take my name
 Love is my redeemer, lifting me up from the ground
 Love is the power, where my freedom song is found

[C1]
   There ain't no grave, gonna hold my body down
   There ain't no grave, gonna hold my body down
   When I hear that trumpet sound I'm gonna rise up out of the ground
   There ain't no grave gonna hold my body down

[V2]
 Fear is a liar, with a smooth and velvet tongue
 Fear is a tyrant, he's always telling me to run
 Love is a resurrection, and love is a trumpet sound
 Love is my weapon, I'm gonna to take my giants down

[C2]
   There ain't no grave, gonna hold my body down
   There ain't no grave, gonna hold my body down
   When I hear that trumpet sound I'm gonna rise up out of the ground
   There ain't no grave gonna hold my body down

[V3]
 There was a battle, a war between death and life
 There on a tree the lamb of God was crucified
 He went on down to hell, He took back every key
 He rose up as a lion, He's setting all the captive's free

[C3]
   There ain't no grave, gonna hold my body down
   There ain't no grave, gonna hold my body down
   When I hear that trumpet sound I'm gonna rise up out of the ground
   There ain't no grave gonna hold my body down
   There ain't no grave could His body down
   There ain't no grave could His body down
   There ain't no grave could His body down

[V4]
 If You walked out of the grave I'm walking too
 If You walked out of the grave I'm walking too
 If You walked out of the grave I'm walking too
 If You walked out of the grave I'm walking too

[C4]
   There ain't no grave, gonna hold my body down
   There ain't no grave, gonna hold my body down
   When I hear that trumpet sound I'm gonna rise up out of the ground
   There ain't no grave gonna hold my body down

[V5]
 There ain't no grave gonna hold my body down
 There ain't no grave gonna hold my body down</lyrics>
