.             Bm7  GD
 I come on my knees
.              Bm7     G D
 To lay down before you,
.                    Bm7 GD
 Bringing all that I am,
.                Bm7     G
 Longing only to know you.
.D
  
.             Bm7  GD
 Seeking your face,
.                  Bm7  GD
 And not only your hand,
.            Bm7    G D
 I find you embracing me
.          Bm7 GD
 Just as I am.

[P1]
.  A     Bm7                 G
   And I lift these songs to you and you alone.
.  A    Bm7                C
   As I sing to you, in my praises make your home.

[C1]
.        G  D        A
   To my audience of one,
.          G       D           A
   You are Father, and You are Son.
.          Bm7
   As Your Spirit flows free,
.         G
   Let it find within me
.    D/F#       G        A
   A heart that beats to praise you.
.          G       D        A
   And now just to know you more
.        G       D     A
   Has become my great reward,
.         Bm7
   To see Your kingdom come
.      G
   And Your will be done.
.    D/F#   G          A          Bm7 GD
   I only desire to be Yours, Lord.

[V2]
 So what could I bring
 To honor your majesty?
 What song could I sing
 That would move the heart of royalty?
 And all that I have
 Is the life that You've given me.
 So Lord let me live for You,
 This song with humility.</lyrics>
