.Am  E     Am    Dm
   When Israel was in Egypt's land
. Am   E   Am
 Let my people go
.   Am      E     Am      Dm
 O-o-ppressed so hard they could not stand
. Am   E   Am
 Let my people go

[V2]
.  Am  Dm   E7
 Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt's land
.Am       Dm    Am     E   Am
 Tell old Pharaoh, Let my people go

[V3]
 Thus saith the Lord, bold Moses said
 If not, I'll smite your first-born dead.

[V4]
 The Lord told Moses what to do
 To lead the children of Israel through.

[V5]
 No more shall they in bondage toil,
 Let them come out with Egypt's spoil.
 Oh let us all from bondage flee,
 And let us all in Christ be free.</lyrics>
