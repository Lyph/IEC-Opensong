 And you have said when we walk though fire,
.Am7            G
 We will not be burned.

 We are not afraid, for You are with us;

[V2]
 Bring them from the west, sons and daughters,
 Call them for Your praise.
 Gather from the east all Your children,
 Coming home again.
 Bring them from afar, all the nations,
 From the north and south,
 drawing all the peoples in.
 Corners of the earth,
 come to see there's
 only one Saviour and King

[B1]
