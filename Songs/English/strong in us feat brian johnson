<title>Strong In Us (feat: Brian Johnson)</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 When darkness rises all around us
 We will see His glory breaking through the night
 The King in all His wonder fills us with His power
 Christ in us, the answer, A hope for all the world

[V2]
 Our God is strong in us
 His love has overcome
 He is alive in us, He is the Risen One
 The same power that raised Him up
 Is the power that lives in us
 Our God is strong in us, Our God is strong in us

[V3]
 His promise stands throughout the ages
 He will never leave us, We are not alone
 Greater than our weakness, He is strong to save us
 We will stand victorious, A hope for all the world

[V4]
 Lift Him up, let the whole world see
 We will never stop singing
 Lift Him up, let the whole world hear
 We will never stop shouting
 Lift Him up, every voice in praise
 Everyone lift Him up</lyrics>
