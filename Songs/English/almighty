.  G         G/B       D
   Almighty, most Holy God!
.  C                    Em   D
   Faithful through the ages;
.  G         G/B       D
   Almighty, most Holy Lord!
.  C           Em  D  G
   Glorious, Almighty God.

[V1]
.    D             G
 The beasts of the field,
.    D            G       G/D                     D
 the birds of the air are silent to call out Your Name;
.    D            G
 The earth has no voice,
.    D         G             G/D            D
 and I have no choice but to magnify God unashamed;
.        Am            D          G   G/B  C
 Let the rocks be kept silent for one more day,
.        Am               D            G  G/B D
 Let the whole world sing out, let the people say!

[V2]
.     D            G
 Well time marches on
.     D             G          G/B                      D
 with the innocence gone and a darkness has covered the earth;
.        D            G
 But His Spirit still dwells,
.   D              G              G/D                        D
 He speaks, &quot;It is well,&quot; and the hopeless still offered new birth;
.        Am                 D              G    G/B C
 He will break the leash of death, it will have no  sting,
.        Am          D              G     G/B D
 Let the prisoner go free, join the dance and sing!</lyrics>
