.     D        G
 Your mercy is falling,
.   D           A
 Is falling, is falling
.     D         G
 Your mercy, it falls
.         Bm           A
 Like the sweet spring rain;
.     D        G
 Your mercy is falling,
.   D           A    D
 Is falling all over me.

[C1]
.  D           G          A
   Hey-oh! I receive Your mercy!
.  D           Bm         A
   Hey-oh! I receive Your grace!
.  D              G        A   D
   Hey-oh! I will dance forevermore!</lyrics>
