[V6]
 Against the demon snares of sin,
 The vice that gives temptation force,
 The natural lusts that war within,
 The hostile men that mar my course;
 Or few or many, far or nigh,
 In every place and in all hours,
 Against their fierce hostility
 I bind to me these holy powers.

[V7]
 Against all Satan's spells and wiles,
 Against false words of heresy,
 Against the knowledge that defiles,
 Against the heart's idolatry,
 Against the wizard's evil craft,
 Against the death wound and the burning,
 The choking wave, the poisoned shaft,
 Protect me, Christ, till Thy returning.

[V8]
 Christ be with me, Christ within me,
 Christ behind me, Christ before me,
 Christ beside me, Christ to win me,
 Christ to comfort and restore me.
 Christ beneath me, Christ above me,
 Christ in quiet, Christ in danger,
 Christ in hearts of all that love me,
 Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.

[V9]
 I bind unto myself the Name,
 The strong Name of the Trinity,
 By invocation of the same,
 The Three in One and One in Three.
 By Whom all nature hath creation,
 Eternal Father, Spirit, Word:
 Praise to the Lord of my salvation,
 Salvation is of Christ the Lord.</lyrics>
