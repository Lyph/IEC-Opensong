.C          G          Am
 When I was held up in chains
.    F         C
 The river was free.
.           G          Am
 When I was covered in stains
.    F         C
 The river was clean.
.           G         Am
 When I was losing my way
.    F     C        GAm
 The river found me.

[C1]
.                C     F
   I can see the river.
.        Dm             Dm3Dm
   I can feel the river.
.                    Am           F
   I'm letting go of all I hold onto.
.               C
   Let it wash away.

[V2]
.             G        Am
 When we were broken inside
.    F         C
 The river was love.
.             G           Am
 When we were thirsty and dry
.         F          C
 You were more than enough.
.             G           Am
 When we were drowning in lies
.    F          C   GAm
 The river saved us.

[C2]
.                     C     F
   I'm dancing in the river.
.              Dm           Dm3Dm
   And I'll be here forever.
.                    Am             F
   I'm letting go of everything but You.
.            C
   Carry me away.
.            G
   Carry me away.
.            Am
   Carry me away.
.            G
   Carry me away.
.            Am
   Carry me away.
.            G
   Carry me away.

[B1]
.                          CFDmAm
   And I can see the river!
.       F           C
   It's washin' me away.
.                    C     F
   My life is in the river.
.                      Dm   Dm3Dm
   And I'll be here forever.
.                    Am                F
   I'm lettin' go of all that I hold onto.
.                  C     F
   Can you see the river?
.                              Dm    Dm3Dm
   When you're standin' in the river,
.                F
   Letting go of everything,
.                 C
   Everything but You.</lyrics>
