<lyrics>[V1]
.             E    Emaj7                        A2
 I can only imagine what it will be like when I walk by your side.
.             E    Emaj7                            A2
 I can only imagine what my eyes will see when Your face is before me.
.             E                  A
 I can only imagine. I can only imagine.

.     A2                          B
   Surrounded by Your glory, what will my heart feel?
.         E
   Will I dance for You Jesus or in awe of You be still?
.         A2                              B
   Will I stand in Your presence or to my knees will I fall?
.         E
   Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speak at all?
.              A2     B            E
   I can only imagine. I can only imagine.

[V2]
.             E    Emaj7                      A2
 I can only imagine when that day comes and I find myself standing in the Son.
.             E    Emaj7                     A2
 I can only imagine when all I will do is forever, forever worship You.
.             E                  A
 I can only imagine. I can only imagine.

[B1]
.               E                  A
   I can only imagine. I can only imagine.</lyrics>
