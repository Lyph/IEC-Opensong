<lyrics>[V1]
 I've made up my mind, no compromise
 I will live for You
 Because of the Cross and what it cost
 I will go for You

[P1]
   Shout His name out, Jesus
   Shout His name out, Jesus

[C1]
   Whoa! I am not ashamed of You
   Whoa! I'm singing it loud
   Whoa! I am living for You now
   No matter what the cost I'll go

[B1]
   This praise is rising in my soul
   I can't contain it any more
   I just have to dance</lyrics>
