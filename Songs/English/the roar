 Verse1:
.  G               C
 I waited for the Lord
. G                    C
 He turned and heard my cry
.Am                    Em
 His mercy opened up my eyes
.       Am            G/H               C
 When I couldn't see and my strength was failing me

[C1]
   Chorus:
.            G           Gsus     D
   I heard the roar of the lion of Judah
.            G         Gsus               D
   I heard the voice that calms the raging sea
.             C         G/H
   He came to me, came to me
.        Am         G/H
   When I needed the Lord
.              C           D        G
   I heard the roar of the lion of Judah

.   G              C

 He appeared in blinding light
.Am                            Em
 He led me through the darkest night
.        Am          G/H                C
 When I couldn't see and my strength was failing me

[B1]
   Bridge:

   I lifted my hands

   All praise to the Savior, all worship to God
.      Am
   With all that I am
.      G/H
   With all in my heart
.      C                          D
   All praise to the Savior, all worship to God</lyrics>
