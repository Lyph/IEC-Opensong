<lyrics>[V1]
 Now the light has gone away; Father, listen while I pray, Asking Thee to watch and keep And to send me quiet sleep.

[V2]
 Jesus, Savior, wash away All that has been wrong today; Help me every day to be Good and gentle, more like Thee.

[V3]
 Let my near and dear ones be Always near and dear to Thee. Oh, bring me and all I love To Thy happy home above.

[V4]
 Now my evening praise I give; Thou didst die that I might live. All my blessings come from Thee; Oh, how good Thou art to me!

[V5]
 Thou, my best and kindest Friend, Thou wilt love me to the end. Let me love Thee more and more, Always better than before.</lyrics>
