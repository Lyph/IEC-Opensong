 He's awakening the hope in me
 By calling forth my destiny
 He's breathing life into my soul
 I will thirst for Him, and him alone

[V2]
 He has come like the rain
 That showers on the barren plain
 So my heart and tongue confess
 Jesus Christ, the hope of man

[V3]
 My hope is in you, God
 I am steadfast, I will not be moved
 I'm anchored, never shaken
 All my hope is in you

[B1]
   BRIDGE:
   He's bringing hope to the hopeless
   And giving his heart to the broken
   And sharing his home with the orphan

[V4]
 He is the joy, He is my joy

[V5]
 He is the hope of the nations
 The Father's heart we're embracing
 He is the song we're declaring
 He is the joy, He is my joy

[V6]
 You're bringing hope to the hopeless
 And giving your heart to the broken
 And sharing your home with the orphan
 You are the joy, You are my joy

[V7]
 You are the hope of the nations
 The Father's heart we're embracing
 You are the song we're declaring
 You are the joy, You are my joy
 Why so downcast oh, oh my soul
 Put your hope in God alone</lyrics>
