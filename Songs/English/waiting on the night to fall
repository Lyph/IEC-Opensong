 Verse 1:
. G                           D
 There's an old man living in the back of your woods tonight
.  Em                     C
 You forgot he was even there, but you've never slipped his mind
. G                         D
 He's living off of scraps of you you never knew you left behind
.  Em7                    C
 And as the sun goes down, he rises with a smile

[C1]
   Chorus:
.                  C
   He's waiting on the night to fall
.              G
   The old man's coming to call
.  D                  Em7
   You don't see the writing on the wall
.                  C
   He'll never step out in the light
.              G
   No, he's just biding time
.        D                     Em
   And while you slumber, he's gonna come and take it all
.                  C    Em
   He's waiting on the night to fall
.                  Am7    A7
   He's waiting on the night to fall

[V3]
 Verse 2:
. G                      D
 He knows you have the answers, but Truth lies dusty on your shelf
.     Em7                           C
 And the sword that you could slay him with has become an ornament and nothing else
.      G                           D
 You could put him back down in his hole in the ground, but he knows you never will
.     Em7                   C
 He's been around so long you got used to the smell

.              G
   No, he's just biding time
.        D                     Em
   And while you slumber, he's gonna come and take it all
.                  C    Em
   He's waiting on the night to fall
.                  Am7    A7

[B1]
   Bridge:
.    C
   He knows he'll never have your soul
.    G
   But he will gladly rob you blind
.   D                       Em
   While you're feasting at his table, he'll tie your hands and numb your mind
.    C
   He'll take you farther than you wanna go
.    G
   He'll keep you longer than you wanna stay
.    Em                            D
   And it will cost you more than you ever thought you'd pay

.                  C
   He'll never step out in the light
.              G

   He's waiting on the night to fall
