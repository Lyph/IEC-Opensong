.     C#m      A            B          E
 I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Your voice,
.       C#m       A       B
 And it told Your love to me;
.      C#m     A           B       E
 But I long to rise in the arms of faith
.       C#m    A        B
 And be closer drawn to Thee.

[C1]
.          C#m  A  EB
   Draw me nearer__
.        C#m          A         B
   To the cross where Thou hast died;
.          C#m  A  EB
   Draw me nearer__
.          C#m               B
   To Your precious bleeding side.

[V2]
 There are great depths of love that I cannot know
 'Till I cross the narrow sea;
 There are heights of joy that I may not reach
 'Till I rest in peace with Thee.

[B1]
.  C#m
   You draw me with Your mercy,
.  G#m
   You draw me with Your love.
.  C#m                          A       B
   You draw me with forgiveness by Your blood.
.  C#m
   You draw me with compassion,
.  G#m
   You draw me as a bride.
.  C#m                        A        B
   You draw me closer to Your precious side.

[V3]
 Consecrate me now to Your service, Lord,
 By the power of grace divine;
 Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope
 And my will be lost in Thine.

[B2]
.          C#m  A EB
   Draw me nearer.</lyrics>
