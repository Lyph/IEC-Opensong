 Verse 1:
.A
  When You stand
.E                 F#m     D5
  I feel the floor of Heaven tremble
.A
  As You breathe
.E           F#m     D5
  We live and have our being, oh
.A
  When you speak
.E               Hm7   D5
  Oh I feel it in my chest
.A
  When You sing
.E            Hm7      D5
  All my fears are put to rest

[C1]
   Chorus:
.  A
    What a wondrous thing
.  Hm7
     I can stand to sing
.  A/C#
      'Cause when I fall to my knees
.        D5
   You're the One who pulls me up again
.  A
    What a mystery
.  Hm7
     That You notice me
.  A/C#
       And in a crowd of ten thousand
.  D5            A
    You don't miss a thing

[V2]
.     E
 Oh oh, oh oh
.           F#m   D5
 You don't miss a thing

[V3]
 Verse 2 (as verse 1)
 When You sigh
 The wind becomes a sonnet
 When You laugh
 The storm around me ceases
 You whisper
 And all my enemies are scattered
 You surround me
 With angels on assignment

[V4]
 Chorus

[V5]
.Hm7             F#m  D5
    You see everything
.A
 Yeah I am seen, and I am known
.Hm7                        F#m   D5
 By the King of kings and the Lord of lords
