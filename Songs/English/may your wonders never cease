.          Am     GC
 Father in Heaven,
.               Am      G    C
 Lord, may Your name be glorified
.          Am     G          C
 Above all others, above all this world,
.           Am         G      C
 Above everything else in our lives.
.    Dm                                   Am
 For nothing else in all of this world matters
.       C                              E7
 But to live our lives for You and You alone.

[V2]
.          Am     GC
 Beautiful Savior,
.         Am          G        C
 Truly we praise Your love for us.
.              Am     G            C
 While we were sinners, in all our weakness,
.          Am        G           C
 Still You gave Your life on the cross.
.    Dm                                   Am
 You saved us, Lord, from all of our transgressions
.        C                         E7
 And delivered us into Your loving arms.

[C1]
.           Am
   May Your wonders never cease,
.           F
   May Your Spirit never leave,
.         C                        G
   May we ever long to see Your face.
.              Am
   And when we turn from You again,
.         F
   Oh how quickly we forget,
.         C                       G
   May we be reminded of Your grace.
.                               AmGC
   May Your wonders never cease.</lyrics>
