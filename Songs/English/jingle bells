 Dashing through the snow
 In a one-horse open sleigh
 Through the fields we go
 Laughing all the way.
 Bells on bob-tail ring
 Making spirits bright
 What fun it is to ride and sing
 A sleighing song tonight.

[C1]
   Jingle bells, jing-jingle bells
   Jingle all the way,
   Oh what fun it is to ride
   In a one-horse open sleigh, brruup
   Jingle bells, jingle bells
   Jingle all the way,
   Oh what fun it is to ride
   In a one-horse open sleigh.</lyrics>
