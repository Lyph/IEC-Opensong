 I'm not holding back, I've got to give You praise
 With every part of me I'm breaking out
 I've got to let You know that You're my everything
 With every part of me I'll praise You now

[V2]
 Pre-chorus :
 And I will dance and sing, You know I'm going to shout it out
 For You my King 'cause You are all I need now

[V3]
 Chorus :
 It's time to get up and dance 'cause we're free now
 It's time to lift up your praise and shout it out now
 It's time to break off the chains 'cause it's a brand new day
 And everything is OK, let's dance

[B1]
   Dance now, everybody shout now
   Lifting up our praise loud
   Dancing in this freedom we know</lyrics>
