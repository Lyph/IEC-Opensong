 Troubles chasing me again, breaking down my best defence,
 I'm looking, God, I'm looking for you
 Weary just won't let me rest and fear is filling up my head.
 I'm longing, God I'm longing for you

[V2]
 But I will

[C1]
   Find you in the place I'm in,
   Find you when I'm at my end,
   Find you when there's nothing left of me
   To offer you except for brokenness.
   You lift me up, you'll never leave me thirsty,
   When I am weak, when I am lost and searching
   I'll find you on my knees.

[V3]
 So what if sorrow shakes my faith, and what if heartache still remains?
 I'll trust you, my God I'll trust you.

[V4]
 'Cause You are faithful and I will...

[C2]
   Find you in the place I'm in,
   Find you when I'm at my end,
   Find you when there's nothing left of me
   To offer you except for brokenness.
   You lift me up, you'll never leave me thirsty,
   When I am weak, when I am lost and searching
   Find you on my knees, my knees.

[B1]
   When my hope is gone, when the fear is strong
   When the pain is real, when it's hard to heal
   When my faith is shaken and my heart is broken
   And my joy is stolen, God I know that...

[V5]
 You lift me up, you'll never leave me thirsty,

[C3]
   Find you in the place I'm in,
   Find you when I'm at my end,
   Find you when there's nothing left of me
   To offer you except for brokenness.
   You lift me up, you'll never leave me thirsty,
   When I am weak, when I am lost and searching
   I'll find you on my knees.</lyrics>
