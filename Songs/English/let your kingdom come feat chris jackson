 Your glorious cause, O God
 Engages our hearts
 May Jesus Christ be known
 Wherever we are
 We ask not for ourselves, but for Your renown
 The cross has saved us so we pray
 Your kingdom come

[C1]
   Let Your kingdom come
   Let Your will be done
   So that everyone might know Your Name
   Let Your song be heard everywhere on earth
   Till Your sovereign work on earth is done
   Let Your kingdom come

[V2]
 Give us Your strength, O God
 And courage to speak
 Perform Your wondrous deeds
 Through those who are weak
 Lord use us as You want, whatever the test
 By grace we'll preach Your gospel
 Till our dying breath</lyrics>
