.B                   A2                     E
 All my dreams I had dreamed were dreams of me.
.B                 A2                          E
 All my hopes were desires of what I wanted to be.
.       B             F#m
 With ambitions put aside,
.  B                     F#m
 I crawl in Your arms to hide.
.       B          A2          E
 I have given everything up to You.

[C1]
.          B  A2        E
   This is all, this is everything.
.          B  A2        E
   This is all, this is everything.
.                  B
   Everything I've got.

[V2]
.B                       A2                     E
 The good things and the bad things are in Your hands.
.B               A2                    E
 My hopes and my dreams are in Your command.
.      B               F#m
 And I come before You now
.     B            F#m
 As imperfect as I am
.      B           A2             E
 And I give, yes I give it all to You.</lyrics>
