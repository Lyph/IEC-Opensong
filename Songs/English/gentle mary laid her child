<lyrics>[V1]
 Gentle Mary laid her Child lowly in a manger; There He lay, the undefiled, to the world a Stranger: Such a Babe in such a place, can He be the Savior? Ask the saved of all the race who have found His favor.

[V2]
 Angels sang about His birth; wise men sought and found Him; Heaven's star shone brightly forth, glory all around Him: Shepherds saw the wondrous sight, heard the angels singing; All the plains were lit that night, all the hills were ringing.

[V3]
 Gentle Mary laid her Child lowly in a manger; He is still the undefiled, but no more a stranger: Son of God, of humble birth, beautiful the story; Praise His Name in all the earth, hail the King of glory!</lyrics>
