 O how sweet to trust in Jesus
 Just to trust His cleansing blood
 Just in simple faith to plunge me
 'Neath the healing cleansing flood

 Yes 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus
 Just from sin and self to cease
 Just from Jesus simply taking
 Life and rest and joy and peace

[V4]
 I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee
 Precious Jesus Savior Friend
 And I know that Thou art with me
 Wilt be with me to the end</lyrics>
