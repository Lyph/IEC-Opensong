<lyrics>[V1]
.           G                 G
 Strong and mighty, strong to save us
.       G              D
 Like a fortress never failing.
.          G                 G
 Strong in battle, strong in kindness,
.        G                             D
 When we stray, Lord, You're strong to find us.

[P1]
.           Em
   When the winds come hard against us,
.          D
   You are steadfast, You are true.
.           Em
   When the ground beneath us trembles,
.                        D
   Your foundation never moves.

[C1]
.         G               C
   Strong tower, high and glorious.
.         G                Dsus D
   Strong tower, mighty in love.
.      G           C
   Our refuge, our defender,
.         G      D     G
   Strong tower, Lord above.

[V2]
.          G                   G
 Strong to lead us through the shadows.
.          G             D
 Strong to carry all our sorrows.

[P2]
.          Em
   When the enemy surrounds us,
.          D
   Closing in as darkness falls,
.             Em
   Though his armies rage against us,
.           D
   They can never scale these walls.

[B1]
.  Em         C           D
   You are my shelter, my shield.
.              Em     C           D
   You are the home I could never deserve.
.              C       G              D
   Here I will serve, ever under Your gaze.
.              C           G            D      Dsus
   Here I will serve, ever singing Your praise.

[B2]
.         C      D     G
   Strong tower, Lord above.
.         C      D     G
   Strong tower, Lord above.</lyrics>
