.D       G      D     G
 King of kings, majesty
.       C      D         Em
 God of heaven living in me
.D      G        D       G
 Gentle Saviour, closest friend
.       C          D             Em
 Strong deliverer, beginning and end

[P1]
.      C         D             Em    D
   All within me falls at Your throne

   I lay my all before You now
.           G       D     Em
   In royal robes I don't deserve
.            C          G  D  G

 Earth and heaven worship You
 Love eternal, faithful and true
 Who bought the nations, ransomed souls
 Brought this sinner near to Your throne

[P2]
   All within me cries out in praise

[C2]
   Your majesty, I can but bow
   I lay my all before You now
   In royal robes I don't deserve
   I live to serve Your majesty</lyrics>
