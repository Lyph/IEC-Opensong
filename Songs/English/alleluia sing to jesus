<lyrics>[V1]
 Alleluia! sing to Jesus! His the scepter, His the throne. Alleluia! His the triumph, His the victory alone. Hark! the songs of peaceful Zion thunder like a mighty flood. Jesus out of every nation has redeemed us by His blood.

[V2]
 Alleluia! not as orphans are we left in sorrow now; Alleluia! He is near us, faith believes, nor questions how; Though the cloud from sight received Him when the forty days were o'er Shall our hearts forget His promise, &quot;I am with you evermore&quot;?

[V3]
 Alleluia! bread of angels, Thou on earth our food, our stay; Alleluia! here the sinful flee to Thee from day to day: Intercessor, Friend of sinners, Earth's Redeemer, plead for me, Where the songs of all the sinless sweep across the crystal sea.

[V4]
 Alleluia! King eternal, Thee the Lord of lords we own; Alleluia! born of Mary, Earth Thy footstool, Heaven Thy throne: Thou within the veil hast entered, robed in flesh our great High Priest; Thou on earth both priest and victim in the Eucharistic feast.</lyrics>
