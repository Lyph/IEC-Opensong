 I tried to fit you in the walls inside my mind
 I try to keep you safely inbetween the lines
 I try to put you in the box that I've designed
 I try to pull you down so we are eye to eye

[C1]
   When did I forget that you've always been the king of the world?
   I try to take life back right out of the hands of the king of the world
   How could I make you so small
   When you're the one who holds it all
   When did I forget that you've always been the king of the world

[V2]
 Just a whisper of your voice can tame the seas
 So who am I to try to take the lead
 Still I run ahead and think I'm strong enough
 When you're the one who made me from the dustOhhhh, you set it all in motion
 Every single moment
 You brought it all to be
 And you're holding on to me</lyrics>
<title>King of The World</title>
