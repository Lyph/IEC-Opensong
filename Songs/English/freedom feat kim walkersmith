 Verse:
 Step out of the shadows, step out of the grave
 Break into the wild and don't be afraid
 Run into wide open spaces
 Grace is waiting for you
 Dance like the weight has been lifted
 Grace is waiting

[C1]
   Chorus:
   Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom, there is freedom
   Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom, there is freedom
   Come out of the dark, just as you are
   Into the fullness of His love
   The Spirit is here, let there be freedom
   Let there be freedom

[V2]
 Verse:
 Bring all of your burdens, bring all of your scars
 Come back to communion, come back to the start
 Run into wide open spaces
 Grace is waiting for you
 Dance like the weight has been lifted
 Grace is waiting

[B1]
   Bridge:
   Chains will fall, prisons shake
   At the sound of Jesus' name
   Lives made whole, hearts awake
   At the sound of Jesus' name</lyrics>
