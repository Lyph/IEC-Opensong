<lyrics>[V1]
 I don't want to be afraid every time I face the waves
 I don't want to be afraid I don't want to be afraid
 I don't want to fear the storm Just because I hear it roar
 I don't want to fear the storm I don't want to fear the storm

[C1]
    Peace be stillsay the word and I will
   Set my feet upon the sea till I'm dancing in the deep
   Oh, peace be still You are here so it is well
   Even when my eyes can't see I will trust the voice that speaks

[V2]
  I'm not gonna be afraid 'Cause these waves are only waves
 Oh, I'm not gonna be afraid I'm not gonna be afraid
 I'm not gonna fear the storm You are greater than its roar
 I'm not gonna fear the storm Oh, I'm not gonna fear at all, yeah

[B1]
    Let faith rise up oh heart believe
   Let faith rise up in me</lyrics>
