.               E                              B
 These thousand hills roll ever on: footprints of a Mighty God;
.              E              A               E   B         E
 They bring me to my knees in praise, amazing love, amazing grace.

[V2]
.         E                             B
 Was on a hill my Savior died, a broken heart and bleeding side;
.            E                 A                E   B             E
 Hill of the Skull, Mount Calvary, the blood He shed, He shed for me.

[V3]
.              E                             B
 When Heaven's hills at last I roam, forever settled in my home;
.              E                  A                     E   B            E
 I'll join the saints around Your throne, Your kingdom, Lord, rolls ever on.

[V4]
.               E                           B
 These thousand hills roll ever on: ripples of a coming storm;
.            E                 A                    E    B          E
 The morning star precedes the dawn, these thousand hills roll ever on.</lyrics>
