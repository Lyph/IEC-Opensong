.   D         (A/C#)   G/B
 My soul finds rest in God alone,
.   D        G     Bm  A/C#
 my Rock and my salva__tion,
.  D        (A/C#)  G
 A fortress strong against my foes,
.    D/F#   G      A  D
 and I will not be shaken.
.       G                  D/F#
 Though lips may bless and hearts may curse,
.    G         (Gsus) Asus   A
 and lies like arrows pierce me,
.     D      (A/C#)   G
 I'll fix my heart on righteousness,
.     D/F#    G       A     D
 I'll look to Him who hears me.

[C1]
.    A/C#        D/F# G           D              G
   O praise Him, hallelujah, my Delight and my Reward;
.      A        D/F#  G             Em      A  D
   Everlasting, never failing, my Redeemer, my God.

[V2]
.     D       (A/C#)    G/B
 Find rest, my soul, in God alone,
. D       G           Bm  A/C#
 amid the world's tempta__tions.
.     D    (A/C#)   G
 When evil seeks to take a hold,
.     D/F#     G     A D
 I'll cling to my salvation.
.       G               D/F#
 Though riches come and riches go,
.      G       (Gsus)  Asus A
 don't set your heart upon  them.
.    D        (A/C#)   G
 The fields of hope in which I sow
.    D/F#  G      A  D
 are harvested in heaven.

[V3]
.     D     (A/C#)   G/B
 I'll set my gaze on God alone
.    D        G       Bm  A/C#
 and trust in Him completely,
.     D     (A/C#) G
 With every day    pour out my soul,
.    D/F#    G         A  D
 and He will prove His mercy.
.       G             D/F#
 Though life is but a fleeting breath,
.  G        (Gsus)   Asus A
 a sigh too brief to mea__sure,
.   D        (A/C#)      G
 My King has crushed the curse of death,
.    D/F# G      A  D
 and I am His fore__ver.

[B1]
.    G             D/F#
   O praise Him, O praise Him.
.      G          D
