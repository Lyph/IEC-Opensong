.   C     F     C
 It came upon a midnight clear
.     F        D7      G  G7
 That glorious song of old
.     C      F       C
 From angels bending near the earth
.   F           G7       C
 To touch their harps of gold
.       E7                 Am
 &quot;Peace on the earth, good will to men
.     G            D7       G     G7
 From heaven's all gracious King;&quot;
.    C        F      C
 The world in solemn stillness lay,
.   F        G7     C
 To hear the angels sing

[V2]
.   C     F     C
 Still through the cloven skies they come
.     F        D7      G   G7
 With peaceful wings unfurled,
.     C      F       C
 And still their heavenly music floats
.   F           G7       C
 O'er all the weary world
.       E7                  Am
 Above its sad and lowly plains
.     G            D7       GG7
 They bend on hovering wing;
.    C        F      C
 And ever o'er its Babel sounds
.   F        G7     C
 The blessed angels sing

[V3]
.   C     F     C
 And ye, beneath life's crushing load
.     F        D7      G   G7
 Whose forms are bending low,
.     C      F       C
 Who toil along the climbing way
.   F           G7       C
 With painful steps and slow
.       E7                  Am
 Look now! for glad and golden hours
.     G            D7     GG7
 Come swiftly on the wing;
.    C        F      C
 O rest beside the weary road
.   F        G7     C
 And hear the angels sing

[V4]
.   C     F     C
 For lo the days are hast'ning on
.     F        D7      G  G7
 By prophets seen of old__
.     C      F       C
 When with the ever-circling years
.   F           G7       C
 Shall come the time foretold
.       E7                  Am
 When peace shall over all the earth
.     G            D7       GG7
 Its ancient splendour fling
.    C        F      C
 And all the world give back the song
.   F        G7     C
 Which now the angels sing</lyrics>
