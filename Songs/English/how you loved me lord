.           Dm
 // How You loved me, Lord!
.        Am
 How You sought me, Lord!
.          Gm                C
 Gave your only Son just for me  //

[C1]
.                 Bb
   // While still lost in sin
.         Am
   In the night of sin
.        Gm                  A7
   Jesus died for me and for you  //

[V2]
.              Dm
 // Your great plan completed there!
.       Am
 All my sin white as snow!
.       Gm
 On the cross all things
.               C
 have been made new!   //</lyrics>
