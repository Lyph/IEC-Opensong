<lyrics>[V1]
.G              C   D
 All heaven declares
.                 C      G
 The glory of the risen Lord.
.            C  D
 Who can compare
.                 C        G
 With the beauty of the Lord?

[C1]
.  G               C D
   Forever He will be
.                      G   D Em
   The Lamb upon the throne.
.                     C D
   I gladly bow the knee
.                    C   G
   And worship Him alone.

[V2]
.G           C  D
 I will proclaim
.                  C     G
 The glory of the risen Lord,
.               C  D
 Who once was slain
.              C      G
 To reconcile man to God.</lyrics>
