<lyrics>[C1]
   The cross has the final word
   The cross has the final word
   Sorrow may come in the darkest night
   But the cross has the final word

[V1]
 There's nothing stronger Nothing higher
 There's nothing greater than the name of Jesus
 All the honor all the power
 All the glory to the name of Jesus

[C2]
   The cross has the final word
   The cross has the final word
   Evil may put up its strongest fight
   But the cross has the final word

[V2]
 There's nothing stronger Nothing higher
 Nothing greater than the name of Jesus
 All the honor all the power
 All the glory to the name of Jesus

[C3]
   The cross has the final word
   The cross has the final word
   The Savior has come with the morning light
   The cross has the final word

[V3]
 Whoh-oh-oh
 Whoh-oh-oh
 All glory and honor is Yours
 Whoh-oh-oh
 Whoh-oh-oh
 All glory and honor is Yours
 Is Yours!

[C4]
   The cross has the final word
   The cross has the final word
   He traded death for eternal life
   The cross has the final word
   (Oh, nothing higher)

[V4]
 Oh, the cross has the final word
 (Nothing greater)
 The cross has the final word
 (All the power)
 The Savior has come with the morning light
 The cross has the final word</lyrics>
