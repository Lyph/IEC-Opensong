 In this mortal world, my heart will seek
 My heart will search, my heart will burn
 If you are not with me
 My heart will seek, my heart will thirst
 My heart will seek, my heart will search
 My heart will thirst
 My heart will seek, my heart will search
 My heart will die without you, Lord

[V2]
 In this mortal world, my heart will seek
 My heart will search, my heart will burn
 My heart will ask, &quot;What's wrong with me?&quot;
 Will search and search endlessly
 My heart will seek, my heart will search
 My heart will thirst
 My heart will seek, my heart will search
 My heart will die without you, Lord

[V3]
 In this mortal world, my heart will seek
 Will fully burn in flames of love
 If He won't fill me with His love
 My heart will burn endlessly
 My heart will burn, keep burning on
 My heart will die
 My heart will burn, keep burning on
 My heart will die without you, Lord</lyrics>
