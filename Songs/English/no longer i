 Verse 1:
.    E
 At the cross, at the cross

 Where I first saw the light

 And the burden of my soul rolled a - way
.    A             E
 It was there, by faith, I received my sight

 Now no longer I but Christ in me

   I will sing of the love that saved me
.       H
   I will bow in the place
.        A         E

 O how endless the hope
