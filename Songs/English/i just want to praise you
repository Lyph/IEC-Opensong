<lyrics>[V1]
 I just want to praise You,
 Lift my hand say I Love You.
 You are everything to me,
 And I exalt Your Holy Name on high.

   Lift my hand say I Love You.
   You are everything to me,
   And I exalt Your Holy Name,
   I exalt Your Holy Name,
   I exalt Your Holy Name,
   On high.</lyrics>
