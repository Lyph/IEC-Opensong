<lyrics>[V1]
.E                  A
 Now through Jesus, we have access
.E             B
 In one Spirit, to the Father
.C#m           A
 Now to Jesus, we're united
.E                B
 One with God and  with each other

[C1]
.  E            A
    Let God be glorified
.  C#m          A
    He's broken all that could divide</lyrics>
