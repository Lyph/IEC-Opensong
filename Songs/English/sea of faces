 I see the city lights all around me
 Everyone's obscure
 Ten million people each with their problems
 Why should anyone care

[P1]
   And in Your eyes I can see

[C1]
   I am not just a man, vastly lost in this world
   Lost in a Sea of Faces
   Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine
   Because you traded Your life for mine

[V2]
 Sometimes my life it feels so trivial
 Immersed in the greatness of space
 Yet somehow you still find the time for me
 It's then You show me Your love

[P2]
   And In Your eyes I can see
   And in Your arms I will be

[C2]
   I am not just a man, vastly lost in this world
   Lost in a Sea of Faces
   Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine
   Because you traded Your life for mine

[B1]
   If only my one heart
   Was all you'd gain from all it cost
   Well I know you would have still been a man
   With a reason to willingly offer your life

[C3]
   I am not just a man, vastly lost in this world
   Lost in a Sea of Faces
   Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine
   Because you traded Your life for mine

[V3]
