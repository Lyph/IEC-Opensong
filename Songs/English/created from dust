<lyrics>[V1]
 Created from dust
 You came and You lived among us
 Taken on our frame, You walked in our pain
 And now You're taking us higher

[V2]
 You stepped into time
 You laid down Your life to save us
 You took on our shame on the cross it was laid
 And now You're taking us higher

[C1]
   We go from glory to glory to glory
   We'll never be the same, never be the same
   We go from glory to glory to glory
   We're forever changed, forever changed

[V3]
 You called Your friend
 Brought into Your endless kingdom
 By the blood I was made, no longer a slave
 And now You're taking us higher

[C2]
   We go from glory to glory to glory
   We'll never be the same, never be the same
   We go from glory to glory to glory
   We're forever changed, forever changed

[B1]
   Until we reach the day love conquers everything
   We'll cry an anthem singing holy, holy
   And when we see that day we're standing face to face
   We'll shout an anthem singing holy, holy

[V4]
 You took on the grave
 So not even death can shake us
 See the victor has won and Heaven has come
 Now You're taking us higher
 Now You're taking us higher

[C3]
   We go from glory to glory to glory
   We'll never be the same, never be the same
   You take us higher and higher and higher
   We're forever changed, forever changed</lyrics>
