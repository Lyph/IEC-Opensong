 Give me the One in whom my hope is securely found

 Give me the One my soul delights in
 Give me the One in whom my hope is securely,

[V5]
 Securely found

[V6]
 Give me the One my soul delights in
 Give me the One in whom my hope is securely found

[V7]
 Give me the One my soul delights in
 Give me the One in whom my hope is securely,

[V8]
 Securely found

[V9]
 Give me Jesus
 Give me Jesus
 you can have all this world
 Give me Jesus
