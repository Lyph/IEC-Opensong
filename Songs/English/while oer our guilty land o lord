<lyrics>[V1]
 While o'er our guilty land, O Lord, We view the terrors of Your sword, O where can all the helpless fly? To whom but You direct their cry?

[V2]
 On You, our guardian God, we call; Before Your throne of grace we fall; But is there no deliv'rance there? And must we perish in despair?

[V3]
 See, we repent, we weep, we mourn; To our forsaken God we turn; O spare our guilty country, spare The Church which You have planted there.

[V4]
 We are the old, the sick, the lame; We blind and deaf cry Jesus' Name. We plead Your mercy for His sake, And trust that You will not forsake.

[V5]
 Christ is our only righteousness, His death for us is our redress. Your promise stronger than our sin; Blot out O Lord what we have been.

[V6]
 We are your children after all,
 Redeemed by Christ after the fall.
 Marked with Your Name in Baptism,
 Our home remains in Your Kingdom.</lyrics>
