 Ever since Eden death has been waiting
 Every life is measured out in years
 I've known its' sorrow i've felt its' shadow
 And I have fought my fears

[V2]
 I know it comes for each of us
 Yet I have hope in knowing that when it does

[C1]
   In the garden Jesus faced it and He chose His Father's will
   The next day He embraced it with open arms on Calvary's Hill
   And death thought it had won until God's only Son
   Left the grave alive again

[V3]
 In the garden He faced it on Calvary He embraced it
 And I praise God, three days later He erased it

[V4]
 Verse 2:
 I have a Savior, what reassurance
 Knowing that He did what I could not
 He fought the battle, now I don't have to
 His grace is all I've got

[V5]
 I'm not a victim anymore
 For death is not an ending, its just a door

[C2]
   In the garden Jesus faced it and He chose His Father's will
   The next day He embraced it with open arms on Calvary's Hill
   And death thought it had won until God's only Son
   Left the grave alive again

[V6]
 In the garden He faced it on Calvary He embraced it
 And I praise God, three days later He erased it

[B1]
   Death's hold has ended, its' strength is gone
   Though I'll go through it, I'll live on

[C3]
   In the garden Jesus faced it and He chose His Father's will
   The next day He embraced it with open arms on Calvary's Hill
   And death thought it had won until God's only Son
   Left the grave alive again

[V7]
 In the garden He faced it on Calvary He embraced it
 And I praise God, three days later He erased it (2x)</lyrics>
