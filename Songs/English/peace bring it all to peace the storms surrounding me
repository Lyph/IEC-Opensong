<lyrics>[V1]
 Peace, bring it all to peace The storms surrounding me
 Let it break at Your name
 Still, call the sea to still, The rage in me to still
 Every wave at Your name

[C1]
   Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
   Jesus, Jesus, You silence fear
   Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
   Jesus, Jesus

[V2]
 Breathe, call these bones to leave Call these lungs to sing
 Once again, I will praise
 Breathe, call these bones to leave Call these lungs to sing
 Once again, I will praise

[B1]
   Your name is a light that the shadows can't deny
   Your name can-not be over-come
   Your name is alive for-ever lifted high
   Your name can-not be over-come</lyrics>
