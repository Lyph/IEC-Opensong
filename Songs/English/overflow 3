<lyrics>[V1]
. G                                   G/F#
 Here I bring my stains and crowns. Gentle river wash me now.
.     Em7                               C2
 Your love is deeper than I know, Your ways higher than I can go.
. G                        G/F#
 Lead me in Your holiness; I will follow, I confess.
. Em7                      C2
 Glory is the song I sing. Your life is living me.

[C1]
.       Em7          D/F#
   And where would I be
.           G           D7sus/A
   Without You, without You?
.   Em7          D/F#   D7sus/A
   Where would I be without You?

[V2]
 I will bow before the cross, cherish my Redeemer's cost.
 There is nothing I can do, but only stand amazed by You.
 Mercy new with ev'ry day, wrapped up in Your arms of grace.
 Nothing more, You're all I need. Your life is living me.

[B1]
.              Dsus      Em7                   C2   G
   Like a waterfall, You fill my heart and overflow.
.            Dsus            Em7
   Like a candle flame, You light my way
.       C2          G   G/F#         Em7 C2
   And lead me as I go, lead me as I go.

[B2]
.    G           Dsus       Em7          C2
   Where would I be without You, without You?
.             G    D/A        Em7   C2
   Spirit overflow; let me overflow.
.             G    D         Em7    C2
   Spirit overflow; let me overflow.
.             G                D
   Spirit overflow; let me overflow.
.            Em7               C2
   Spirit overflow; let me overflow.
.             G                D/F#
   Let me overflow; let me overflow.
.            Em7               C2
   Let me overflow; let me overflow.</lyrics>
