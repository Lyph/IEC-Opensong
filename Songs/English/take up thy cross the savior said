<lyrics>[V1]
 &quot;Take up thy cross,&quot; the Savior said, &quot;If thou wouldst My disciple be; Deny thyself, the world forsake, And humbly follow after Me.&quot;

[V2]
 Take up thy cross, let not its weight Fill thy weak spirit with alarm; His strength shall bear thy spirit up, And brace thy heart and nerve thine arm.

[V3]
 Take up thy cross, nor heed the shame, Nor let thy foolish pride rebel; Thy Lord for thee the cross endured, And saved thy soul from death and hell.

[V4]
 Take up thy cross then in His strength, And calmly sin's wild deluge brave, 'Twill guide thee to a better home, It points to glory o'er the grave.

[V5]
 Take up thy cross and follow Christ, Nor think til death to lay it down; For only those who bear the cross May hope to wear the glorious crown.

[V6]
 To Thee, great Lord, the One in Three,
 All praise forevermore ascend:
 O grant us in our home to see
 The heavenly life that knows no end.</lyrics>
