 Lord your ways are higher than my mind could ever reach
 But still you call me to come and speak with You

[V2]
 And now I speak straight to the king above all kings
 And I know that You are always listening

[V3]
 And You hear me
 Oh, I know You hear me

[V4]
 If you give to me a crown then at Your feet I lay it down</lyrics>
