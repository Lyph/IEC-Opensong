<lyrics>[V1]
 Who is there like You,
 And who else would give their life for me,
 Even suffering in my place?
 And who could repay You?
 All of creation looks to You,
 And You provide for all You have made.

[V2]
 So I'm lifting up my hands,
 Lifting up my voice, lifting up Your name,
 And in Your grace I rest,
 For Your love has come to me
 And set me free.
 And I'm trusting in Your word,
 Trusting in Your cross, trusting in Your blood
 And all Your faithfulness,
 For Your power at work in me
 Is changing me.</lyrics>
