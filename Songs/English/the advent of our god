<lyrics>[V1]
 The advent of our God Shall be our theme for prayer Come, let us meet him on the road And place for Him prepare.

[V2]
 The everlasting Son Incarnate stoops to be, Himself the servant's form puts on To set His people free.

[V3]
 Come, Zion's daughter, rise To meet your lowly King, Nor let your faithless heart despise The peace He comes to bring.

[V4]
 As judge, on clouds of light, He soon will come again And all His scattered saints unite With Him on high to reign.

[V5]
 Before the dawning day Let sin be put to flight; No longer let the law hold sway, But walk in freedom's light.

[V6]
 All glory to the Son
 Who comes to set us free,
 With Father, Spirit, ever One,
 Through all eternity.</lyrics>
