<lyrics>[V1]
 Lord, keep us steadfast in Thy Word; Curb those who fain by craft and sword Would wrest the kingdom from Thy Son And set at naught all He hath done.

[V2]
 Lord Jesus Christ, Thy pow'r make known, For Thou art Lord of lords alone; Defend Thy Christendom that we May evermore sing praise to Thee.

[V3]
 O Comforter of priceless worth, Send peace and unity on earth. Support us in our final strife And lead us out of death to life.</lyrics>
