<lyrics>[V1]
 And the Lord shall cause his glorious
 Voice to be heard
 And you shall have a song in the night
 Come to the Mountain
 Of the Lord
 See His glory and His might

[C1]
   He's the Mighty One of Israel
   The Mighty One of Israel
   His voice shall be heard
   In the Power of His Word
   The Mighty One of Israel

[V2]
 The eyes of the blind
 Shall be opened and they'll see
 The ears of the deaf shall hear
 The lame man shall jump
 And shall leap as a heart
 The tongue of the dumb shall sing

[V3]
 The Lord shall cause his glorious
 Beauty to be seen
 The desert shall bloom and rejoice
 Say to them that
 Are fearful of heart
 Be strong and
 Listen to His voice</lyrics>
