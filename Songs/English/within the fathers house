<lyrics>[V1]
 Within the Father's house The Son hath found His home; And to His temple suddenly The Lord of Life hath come.

[V2]
 The doctors of the law Gaze on the wondrous child, And marvel at His gracious words Of wisdom undefiled.

[V3]
 Yet not to them is giv'n The mighty truth to know, To lift the fleshly veil which hides Incarnate God below.

[V4]
 The secret of the Lord Escapes each human eye, And faithful pond'ring hearts await The full epiphany.

[V5]
 Lord, vis-it Thou our souls, And teach us by Thy grace Each dim revealing of Thyself With loving awe to trace;

[V6]
 Till from our darkened sight
 The cloud shall pass away,
 And on the cleansèd soul shall burst
 The everlasting day.

[V7]
 Till we behold Thy face,
 And know, as we are known,
 Thee, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
 Co-equal Three in One.</lyrics>
