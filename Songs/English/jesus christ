 Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice:
.G           D/F#   G             Asus   A
 You became nothing, poured out to death.
.D    A/D        G/D              D
 Many times I've wondered at Your gift of life,
.    G           Asus       A  D
 and I'm in that place once a__gain,
.G           Asus       A  D
 I'm in that place once a__gain.

[C1]
.      D/F#         G2            D/F#            Asus A#
   And once again I look upon the cross where You died.
.      D/F#            G2            D2/F2    Asus A
   I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside.
.  Bm7          G
   Once again I thank You,
.  D/F#         A           G/B  AsusAD
   Once again I pour out my life.

.D       A/D     G/D        D
 Now You are exalted to the highest place:
.G           D/F#           G            Asus
 King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow.
.A
  
.D       A/D    G/D            D
 But for now, I marvel at Your saving grace,
.    G           Asus        A  D
 and I'm full of praise once a__gain,
.G           Asus        A  D
 I'm full of praise once a__gain.

[B1]
.  G                 Asus  A
   Thank You for the cross,

   Thank You for the cross,
.  G                 Asus   A# D
   Thank You for the cross, my Friend.</lyrics>
