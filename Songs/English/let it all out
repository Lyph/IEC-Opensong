.A
 Let it all out. (Get it all out.)
.       C#m
 Rip it out, remove it.
.      D                                A
 Don't be alarmed when the wound begins to bleed.
.               A
 Cause we're so scared to find out (what this life's all about),
.   C#m
 so scared we're going to lose it.
.    D                                 A
 And knowing all along that's exactly what we need.

[P1]
.      D
   And today I will trust you with the confidence
.       F#m             E
   of a man who's never known defeat.
.      E/G#                   D
   But tomorrow, upon hearing what I did
.         F#m             E
   I will stare at you in disbelief.
.      D            F#m E E/G#       D         E
   Oh, inconsistent me... crying out for consistency.

[C1]
.      A          C#m                 D
   And you said I know that this will hurt,
.  F#m            E
   but if I don't break your heart,
.       D
   then things will just get worse.
.  A             C#m               D
   If the burden seems too much to bear,
.            F#m          E
   Remember, the end will justify
.      E/G#    D       E      A
   the pain it took to get us there.

[V2]
.         A
 And I'll let it be known (at times I have shown)
.C#m
 signs of all my weakness,
.    D                        A
 but somewhere in me there is strength.
.    A
 And you promise me (that you believe)
.   C#m
 in time I will defeat this,
.       D                        A
 'cause somewhere in me there is strength.

[P2]
.      D
   And today I will trust you with the confidence
.       F#m             E
   of a man who's never known defeat.
.           E/G#           D
   And I'll try my best to just forget
.       E
   that that man isn't me.

[B1]
.        A                              F#m
   Reach out to me, make my heart brand new
.                         C#m      D
   every beat will be for you, for you.
.  A                       F#m
   And I know you know you touched my life
.           C#m                                D     AF#mC#mDEA
   when you touched my heavy heart and made it light.</lyrics>
