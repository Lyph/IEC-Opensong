<lyrics>[V1]
 From the brightness of His glory
 Jesus, the Son of God, descends
 Takes on the nature of a servant
 Jesus, obedient to death
 The Father willed to crush Him
 As a sacrifice for sin
 He satisfied God's justice
 And in victory rose again

[C1]
   You are highly exalted
   Name above all names Worthy of all praise
   You are reigning in glory
   Jesus, You're the King over everything
   Exalted to the highest place
   Given the Name above all other names

[V2]
 The tomb is empty Christ has risen
 Jesus, the Lamb once crucified
 The angels never cease to worship
 Jesus, in heaven glorified
 To Him belongs the power
 The wisdom, might, and strength
 All glory and dominion
 To the Lord of every age

[B1]
   Our knees will bow
   Our tongues proclaim
   That You are Lord of all</lyrics>
