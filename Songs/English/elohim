 VERSE: 1
.Eb
 I stand upon the solid rock of faith in Christ

[V3]
 This steadfast hope shall not
.                     Ab
 Break apart within the trial

[V4]
 I am assured His promises will never fail
.Fm
 As long as life remains, He is faithful

.  Eb             Bb

   He does not envy, He does not boast
.  Eb                        Bb
   His ways are higher than my own
.                         Ebadd2/G   Ab
   His thoughts consume the great unknown

   Of this alone I am sure, my God is love

 I draw my breath under His
 Created windswept sky

 After my flesh retires
 From dusk until the dawn
 He calls His children home
 His righteous love outlasts generations
