<lyrics>[V1]
.E                                A
 How lovely is Your dwelling place,
.        B
 O Lord Almighty.
.E                                    B
 My soul it longs and even faints for You.
.E                             A
 For here my heart is satisfied,
.            B
 Within Your presence.
.E                                 B
 I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings.

[C1]
.  A2
   Better is one day in Your courts,
.  B
   Better is one day in Your house,
.  A2
   Better is one day in Your courts
.  B
   Than thousands elsewhere.

[V2]
.E                                A
 One thing I ask and I would seek;
.            B
 To see Your beauty,
.E                                   B
 To find You in the place Your glory dwells.

[B1]
.  C#m                    B
   My heart and flesh cry out
.  A2                     B
   For You, the living God;
.  C#m                     A2     B
   Your Spirit's water for my soul.
.  C#m                   B
   I've tasted and I've seen,
.  A2                 B
   Come once again to me;
.  C#m                  B
   I will draw near to You,
.  A2                  B
   I will draw near to You.</lyrics>
