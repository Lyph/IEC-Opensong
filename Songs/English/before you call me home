 Black cars in line
 The family has arrived
 The church fills up
 They've come to say goodbye
 If this was my last day
 What would they have to say?

[V2]
 Did I live a life of love
 Did I give myself away
 Will my kids think of you
 When they speak my name
 Was I always full of hope
 Always reaching out
 I wanna cross the finish line
 And know I made it count
 Before you call me home
 Before you call me home

[V3]
 I wanna be a man
 Who builds his children up
 With a wife who feels
 Like she's been truly loved
 And if I've let them down
 Lord help me start right now

[V4]
 I wanna live a life of love
 I wanna give myself away
 I want my kids to think of you
 When they speak my name
 Always full of hope
 Always reaching out
 I wanna cross the finished line
 And know I made it count
 Before you call me home
 Before you call me home

[V5]
 And when I finally close my eyes
 And wake up on the other side
 With my life laid out in the sun
 I wanna hear you say well done, well done

[V6]
 I wanna live a life of love
 I wanna give myself away
 I want my kids to think of you
 When they speak my name
 Always full of hope
 Always reaching out
 I wanna cross the finish line
 And know I made it count
 Before you call me home
 Before you call me home
 Before you call me home
 Before you call me home
 (Before you call me home)...</lyrics>
