 1 verse:
.   C       Am          Em        G
 I ride the dawn It's in the name I was given
.       C          Am
 Can't get away from the meaning
.               Em
 I'll always rise I'll always shine
.    C    Am      Em             G
 In a blackout i will illuminate the dark
.      C         Am
 You won't escape the beaming
.           Em
 I will glimmer, I will glow

 Light of the world It's the name we were given
