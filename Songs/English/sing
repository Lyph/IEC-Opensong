.A                                  E
 I love the way, I love the way you carry on.
.    F#m                                               D/F#
 You make me wanna say, You make me wanna sing another love song.
.             A                       E
 Sing another love song, Sing another love song,
.             F#m          D/F#
 Sing another love song to you.

.A
 Bury my head for the shame,
.                          E
 you pick me up, you say I look like you.
.          F#m
 Though it makes no sense to me,
.                                 D/F#
 You make me believe that I could trust someone.
.             A
 I could ever trust someone,
.             E
 I could ever trust someone,
.             F#m
 I could ever trust someone,
.             D/F#
 I could ever trust someone.

   Sing another love song. Sing another love song.

.  A
 I walk through flame, I touch the fire,
.                      E
 You know that I still burn for You.
.F#m
 Flood water, rain crash down, soak the ground,
.        D/F#                               A
 Still I thirst for you. Still I thirst for you.

[B1]
.               A                       E
   Sing another love song. Sing another love song.
.            F#m                       D/F#
   Though it makes no sense to me, You make me wanna sing,
.                A
   Make me wanna sing...

[B2]
.         D/F#                A
   I just wanna trust someone.</lyrics>
