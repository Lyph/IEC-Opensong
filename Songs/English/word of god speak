<lyrics>[V1]
.    Gsus/F  C           Csus C
 I'm finding myself at a loss  for words,
.C2(no3)    C/F          Gsus/F  C/F
 And the funny thing is, it's o__kay.
.               Gsus/F Gsus C   Csus C
 The last thing I      need  is to   be heard,
.C2(no3)   C/F    F2(no3)     C/F
 But to hear what You would say.

[C1]
.                   C
   Word of God, speak.
.                              Gsus
   Would You pour down like rain,
.  G       F/A   Bb2(no3)        F
   Washing my eyes to see Your majesty,
.                     C
   To be still and know
.                          Gsus
   That You're in this place?
.  G          F/A   Bb2(no3)
   Please let me stay and rest
.          F
   In Your holiness.
.                    C CsusCC2(no3)C/FF2(no3)C/F
   Word of God, speak.

[V2]
.    Gsus/F  C             Csus  C
 I'm finding myself in the midst  of You,
.C2(no3)    C/F      Gsus/F   C/F
 Beyond the music, beyond the  noise.
.         Gsus/F Gsus C      Csus C
 All that I      need  is to be   with You,
.    C2(no3)   C/F F2(no3)       C/F
 And in the quiet, hear Your voice.

[B1]
.                C         Csus C
   I'm finding myself at a loss  for words,
.  C2(no3)    C/F          F2(no3) C/F
   And the funny thing is, it's o__kay.</lyrics>
