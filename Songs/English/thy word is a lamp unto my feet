.  E             B            E          A       B     E
   Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path. (2x)

[V1]
.B            F#m    C#m                G#m
 When I feel afraid, think I've lost my way,
.A            B             A    E
 Still You're there right beside me.
.    B              F#m     C#m             G#m
 And nothing will I fear as long as You are near.
.A         B       C#sus     B
 Please be near me to the end.

[V2]
.B             F#m      C#m             G#m
 I will not forget Your love for me and yet
.   A        B       A     E
 My heart forever is wandering.
.    B           F#m        C#m             G#m
     Jesus be my guide, and hold me to Your side,
.A      B        C#sus     B
 I will love You to the end.

[B1]
.  E             B            E          A       B     E
   Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
.        A       B     E
   And a light unto my path.
.             A       B     E
   You're the light unto my path.</lyrics>
