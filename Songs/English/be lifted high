 Bethel Live - Be Lifted High

[C1]
   Be lifted high be lifted high
   For Your glory, be lifted high
   Be lifted high be lifted high
   For Your glory, be lifted high

[V2]
 You're the King of all the ages You're the author of salvation
 You're the reason why we're singing for Your glory
 Lord release the sound of Heaven let it rise in every nation
 We will join the anthem singing

[V3]
 You're the everlasting Father You're the all consuming fire
 You're the reason why we're living for Your glory
 We will be the generation calling down the reign of Heaven
 We will join the anthem singing</lyrics>
