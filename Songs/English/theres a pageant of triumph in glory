<title>There's a pageant of triumph in glory</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 There's a pageant of triumph in glory,
 As Jesus the King takes His throne.
 The shame of the cross is exchanged for a crown,
 And heaven applauds the King.

[V2]
 The Son has the Father's approval,
 He perfectly followed the plan
 To suffer and die for the sins of the world,
 He poured out His love for our shame.

[C1]
   Let God arise with shouts of joy,
   With songs of praise and trumpet sound;
   Let music play and hearts be free,
   Let God arise!

[V3]
 Death could not keep Him in prison,
 He burst through the shackles of hell;
 He settled the score with the evil one,
 And heaven applauds the King.

[V4]
 The fullness of Christ is my treasure,
 I've cast off the past with its shame.
 The power of the Father has raised me to life,
 I'm a son, I'm forgiven and free.</lyrics>
