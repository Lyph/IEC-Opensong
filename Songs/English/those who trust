.          Em7              B7
 Those who trust in the Lord are a strong mountain;
.          Am7  B7       Em7
 They will not, not be moved. (2X)

[V2]
.          Em7              B7
 Those who trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion;
.          Am7  B7       Em7
 They will not, not be moved. (2X)

[V3]
.           Em7                  B7
 Christ the King, He sets my feet on a firm foundation
.          Am7  B7       Em7
 That will not, not be moved. (2X)

[C1]
.             C                B7
   Though the world moves like mad,
.                       Em7
   You, O Lord, are faithful;
.  D2/F#  G             C           B7
   Jesus, You, You will not, not be changed.</lyrics>
