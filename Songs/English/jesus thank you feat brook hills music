 The mystery of the cross I cannot comprehend
 The agonies of Calvary
 You the perfect Holy One, crushed Your Son
 Who drank the bitter cup reserved for me

[C1]
   Your blood has washed away my sin
   Jesus, thank You
   The Father's wrath completely satisfied
   Jesus, thank You
   Once Your enemy, now seated at Your table
   Jesus, thank You

[V2]
 By Your perfect sacrifice I've been brought near
 Your enemy You've made Your friend
 Pouring out the riches of Your glorious grace
 Your mercy and Your kindness know no end

[B1]
   Lover of my soul
   I want to live for You</lyrics>
