<lyrics>[V1]
.           A2             D
 Oh Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder
.         A2      E          Bm         A2
 Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made;
.                            D
 I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder:
.                 A2      E  Bm       A2
 Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed.

[V2]
.                 A2                D
 When through the woods, and forest glades I wander,
.             A2         E       Bm     A2
 And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
.                            D
 When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,
.              A2       E        Bm     A2
 And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.

[V3]
.           A2                  D
 And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
.            A2     E          Bm      A2
 Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
.                             D
 That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
.             A2     E     Bm     A2
 He bled and died to take away my sin.

[V4]
.                  A2                 D
 When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
.            A2         E         Bm      A2
 And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart;
.                           D
 Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
.              A2      E       Bm         A2
 And there proclaim my God how great Thou art!

[C1]
.                A2      D             A2
   Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee,
.                 E                   A2
   How great Thou art, how great Thou art;
.                        D             A2
   Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee,
.                 E  Bm               A2
   How great Thou art, how great Thou art.</lyrics>
