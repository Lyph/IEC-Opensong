<lyrics>[V1]
 We Have Overcome
 We are purified
 We are hidden in the wounds of Christ
 He has paid the price
 He has brought us near
 To behold the glory of The Lord

[V2]
 So we will not fear
 Through the storm and through the flood
 By Your spirit, by Your blood
 We will stand, we will stand
 And with a trumpet call
 You will open up the sky
 Come with glory and with might
 And we will be with the Lamb

[V3]
 Hallelujah,
 Hallelujah,
 We will be with You

[V4]
 Though the storm may come
 We are unashamed
 Of the name above all other names
 He's our victory
 He's our joy and prize
 He's the reason we lay down our lives</lyrics>
