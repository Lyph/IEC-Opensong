<lyrics>[V1]
.E
 You've kept watch over me
.      Amaj7
 since I was a child.
.E
 You've stayed close when my heart
.    B7
 has gone running wild.
.C#m
 You've welcomed me back
.Amaj7
 again and again.
.E                    F#m
 You've offered Your kindness,
.   C#m      D2
 forgiven my sin.

[C1]
.  E                    Amaj7
   You're the source of all the good gifts I know;
.  E                B7
   No one else can equal the love You show.
.  E                    C#m
   Though my praise for You often comes so slow,
.  Amaj7          B7                  E
   How I long for my life with You to grow.

[V2]
 In Your actions, You show
 the proof of Your care.
 In Your presence comes comfort;
 You're ev'rywhere.
 In Your mercy, I find
 hope that will last.
 In Your second life,
 I am saved from my past.</lyrics>
