<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus, hope of the nations
 Jesus, comfort for all who mourn
 You are the source of heaven's hope on earth
 Jesus, light in the darkness
 Jesus, truth in each circumstance
 You are the source of heaven's light on earth
 In history You lived and died
 You broke the chains You rose to life

[V2]
 You are the hope living in us
 You are the Rock in whom we trust
 You are the light shining for all the world to see
 You rose from the dead conquering fear
 Our Prince of Peace drawing us near
 Jesus our hope living for all who will receive
 Lord we believe.</lyrics>
