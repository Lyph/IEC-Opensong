 VERSE 1:
.Em                     G
 You put Your love on the line
.Em                              G
 To bear the weight of sin that was mine
.Em                 G
 Washing my rivers of wrongs
.Em                         G    D
 Into the sea of Your infinite love

.         C
   In Your love forever
.      G
   With all I am
.         D
   In Your grace I stand

 Furious love laid waste to my sin
