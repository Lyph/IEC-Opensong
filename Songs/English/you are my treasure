.A              E
 Faithful Lord, fill my cup
.          D                              E
 With Your grace and love, Your grace and love.
.    A                   E
 The pleasures that this world's sure of
.     D                             E
 Will never be enough, can never be enough

[C1]
.                 D   A
   'Cause I'm created for You alone,
.  E                   A
   Bought with a price I'm not my own
.  D      A
   Seated in the heavenlies
.  E                A
   There's no place I'd rather be
.       Bm       A/C# D A/C# E
   Than with You for__ever,  Lord
.  D2         A   D2  ED2AD2ED2
