<lyrics>[V1]
 A tender blade of grass so green
 Crushed in the footprint of the Nazarene
 Sprang back and waved a message to a bird on the wing
 That's Him

[V2]
 In a mighty old river in the noonday sun
 An outcast kept crying, «I tell you He's the One»
 A voice out of Heaven said, «I'm pleased with My Son»
 That's Him

[V3]
 That's Him, He's Sharon's rose
 That's Him, our Morning Star that glows
 He's Alpha, Omega, the beginning and the end
 That's Him

[V4]
 Angry waves splashing everywhere
 He's asleep in the boat, does He even care?
 We're all so afraid, He just keeps lying there
 That's Him

[V5]
 Then He raised His hands above His head
 Said, «Peace, be still» and the water fled
 A wave tapped the wind on the shoulder and said, «Shh, that's Him»
 That's Him, that's Him

[V6]
 There'll be two at work in a field one day
 One will be left, the other called away
 One falls to his knees, «It's too late» he'll say
 'Cause that's Him

[V7]
 With one foot on the sea and one on the shore
 Declaring the time, it will never be anymore
 The trumpet will shout like never before
 That's Him

[V8]
 That's Him, He's Sharon's rose, that's Him
 Our Morning Star that glows
 He's Alpha, Omega, beginning and the end
 That's Him
 He's Alpha, Omega, the beginning and the end
 That's Him, that's Him</lyrics>
