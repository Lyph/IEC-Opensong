 Everlasting God
 The years go by but You're unchanging
 In this fragile world
 You are the only firm foundation

[V2]
 Always loving, always true
 Always merciful and good, so good

[V3]
 Yesterday today and forever
 You are the same, You never change
 Yesterday today and forever
 You are faithful and we will trust in You

[V4]
 Uncreated one
 You have no end and no beginning
 Earthly power fades
 But there is no end to your kingdom

[V5]
 Yahweh, God unchanging
 Yahweh, firm foundation</lyrics>
