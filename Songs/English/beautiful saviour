.Em7    F2  F        G         C/E     F   C
 All my days, I will sing this song of gladness,
.Em7     F2    F       G        C/E  F
 Give my praise to the Fountain of delights.
.   Dm7 Fmaj7 G                 F     C/E G
 For in my    helplessness, You heard my  cry,
.    Dm7   Fmaj7 Em7                     A/C# D
 And waves of    mercy poured down on my life.

   Beautiful Savior, Wonderful Counselor,
.             Am               Am/G
   Clothed in majesty, Lord of history,

   You're the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

   You're the Risen One, heaven's Champion,

   And You reign, You reign over all.

[V2]
 I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer.
 I will sing of the Lamb that never fails,
 Of sins forgiven, of conscience clear,
 Of death defeated, and life without end.

[B1]
.  Em        F         C
   Wonderful Conselor, beautiful Risen One!

.Em7       F2 F          G         C/E   F C
 I long to be  where the praise is never ending,
.Em7      F2   F          G     C/E   F
 Yearn to dwell where the glory never fades,
.(same chords as before)
 Where countless worshipers sing one song,
 And the voices of nations sing, &quot;Worthy! Worthy! Worthy!&quot;
.Em7     F2         G
 Worthy, beautiful, beautiful, One.
.               Em7     F2         G
 Jesus, You are worthy, beautiful, beautiful, One.
.              Em7     F2         G
 Jesus, You're worthy, beautiful, beautiful, One.
.        Em7     F2         G
 You are worthy, beautiful, Risen One.</lyrics>
