<lyrics>[V1]
.D                   G    A            D
 There is a longing, only You can fill;
.F#m      Bm7     G               G/A A
 A raging tempest only You can still.
.Bm         Bm/A                G               D/F#
 My soul is thirsting, Lord, to know You as I'm known;
.Em7            D/F#       G                 G/A
 Drink from the river that flows before Your throne

[C1]
.  A       D     F#m7            Bm7      Bm7/A
   Take me deeper, deeper in love with You;
.  Em7            D/F#               G/A
   Jesus, hold me close in Your embrace.
.  A       D        A/C#              Bm        Bm/A
   Take me deeper, deeper than I've ever been before;
.                 G                 D/F#
   I just want to love You more and more,
.        Em7        G/A A  D
   How I long to be deeper in love

[V2]
.D                   G      A         D
 Sunrise to sunrise, I will seek Your face;
.F#m          Bm7           G               G/A   A
 Drawn by the Spirit to the promise of Your grace.
.Bm           Bm/A           G              D/F#
 My heart has found in You a hope that will abide;
.Em7          D/F#          G         G/A
 Here in Your presence, for ever satisfied.</lyrics>
