.E2                   B2
 When the music fades,
.                     F#m7
 All is stripped away,
.                  B7sus
 And I simply come,
.E2                   B2
 Longing just to bring
.                         F#m7
 Something that's of worth
.                           B7sus
 That will bless Your heart.

[P1]
.  F#m7           E/G#            B7sus
   I'll bring You more than a song,
.                  F#m7             E/G#             B7sus
   For a song in itself is not what You have required.
.  F#m7            E/G#       B7sus
   You search much deeper within, through the way things appear;
.  F#m7           E/G#          B7sus
   You're looking into my heart.

.  E2                          B2/D# .
   I'm coming back to the heartof worship,
.           F#m7         E/G# .    A            B7sus .
   And it's all about You;    it's all about You,     Jesus;
.  E2
   I'm sorry, Lord,
.               B2/D# .
   for the thingI've made it
.            F#m7         E/G# .    A            B7sus .     E
   When it's all about You;    it's all about You,     Jesus.

[V2]
 King of endless worth,
 No one could express
 How much You deserve;
 Though I'm weak and poor,
 All I have is Yours,
 Every single breath.</lyrics>
