 Verse: 1
.Dm                         F
 Try to stop Your love and You would wage a war
.  C                            Gm
 Try to take the very thing You gave Your life for
.Dm                        F
 You would come running  tear down every wall
.C                                  Gm
 All the while You're shouting  &quot;My Love, you're worth it all&quot;.

[C1]
   Chorus:
.  Gm          A#                      F
   God you pursue me with power and glory
.               C
   Unstoppable Love that never ends
.  Gm         A#                        F
   You're unrelenting with passion and mercy
.               C
   Unstoppable Love that never ends

[V2]
 Verse: 2
 You broke into the silence and sang a song of hope
 A melody, a sound in the deep of my soul
 You have come running You tore down every wall
 All the while you're shouting, &quot;My Love you're worth it all&quot;

[B1]
   Bridge:
.    A#                 Dm
   No sin, no shame, no past, no pain
.       F                     C
   Can separate me from Your love
.      A#                 Dm
   No height, no depth, no fear, no death
.   F               C
   Can separate me from Your love

[V3]
.Dm               F
 Try to stop Your love and You would wage a war</lyrics>
