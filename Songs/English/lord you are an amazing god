<lyrics>[V1]
 Looking in the sky,
 whoever could deny Your glory?
 Gazing into space,
 how small the human race appears.
 Seeing You in all Your majesty,
 I wonder how it could be
 That You delight in me.

[V2]
 Lord You are an amazing God
 Lord You are an amazing God
 Lord You are an amazing God
 And I love You, I love You.

[V3]
 Lord of everything, no other god or king is like You.
 Powerful and strong,
 yet tender is Your song to me.
 Knowing the extent of all my sin,
 however could You be pleased
 To pour Your love on me?

[V4]
 You light up the heavens with just one word,
 You measure the mountains in Your hand;
 Yet You treasure the broken
 and make them whole,
 You crown us with Your love.</lyrics>
