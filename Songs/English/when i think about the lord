.       G               D/F#
 When I think about the Lord,
.       Em               E7
 How He saved me, how He raised me,
.       Am7                Em
 How He filled me with the Holy Ghost,
.       C                D
 How He healed me to the uttermost,
.       G               D/F#
 When I think about the Lord,
.       Em               E7
 How He picked me up and turned me around,
.       Am7        F
 How He set my feet
.         D
 On solid ground:

[C1]
.                    G
   It makes me wanna shout,
.        D/F#              Em
   &quot;Hallelujah! Thank You, Jesus!
.               E7                Am7
   Lord, You're worthy of all the glory
.              Em                C    D
   And all the honor and all the praise!&quot;</lyrics>
