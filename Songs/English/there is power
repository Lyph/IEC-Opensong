 Where two or more
 Are gathered in His name
 He is there
 For all who come
 Who run to Him in faith
 He is there

[C1]
   There is power in the name of Jesus
   There is power, power in His name
   There is power in the name of Jesus
   There is power, power in His name

[V2]
 No fear, no lie
 Can stand against us now
 He is here
 The Word has come
 To silence every doubt
 He is here

[C2]
   There is power in the name of Jesus
   There is power, power in His name
   There is power in the name of Jesus
   There is power, power in His name

[B1]
   One name, one name can save
   One name breaks every chain
   One name, always
   One name, Jesus
   One name, one name remains
   One name, we will proclaim
   One name, always
   One name

[C3]
   There is power in the name of Jesus
   There is power, power in His name
   There is power in the name of Jesus
   There is power, power in His name

[V3]
 There's power in His name
 There's power in His name</lyrics>
