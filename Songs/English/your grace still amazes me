 Your Grace Still Amazes Me

[V2]
 My faithfull Father, enduring friend
 Your tender mercy is like a river with no wind
 It overwhelms me covers my sin
 Each time i come into your presence I stand in wonder once again

[C1]
   Your grace still amazes me
   Your love is still a mystery
   Each day i fall on my knees
   'cause your grace still amazes me
   Your grace still amazes me

[V3]
 Oh patient savior, you make me whole
 You are the author and the healer of my soul
 What can i give you lord what can i say
 I know there's no way to repay you only to offer you my praise

[C2]
   Your grace still amazes me
   Your love is still a mystery
   Each day i fall on my knees
   Cause your grace still amazes me
   Your grace still amazes me

[B1]
   Its deeper, it's wider, it's stronger, it's higher
   Its deeper, it's wider, it's stronger, it's higher
   Than anything my eyes can see

[C3]
   Your grace still amazes me
   Your love is still a mystery
   Each day i fall on my kness
   Cause your grace still amazes me
   Your grace still amazes me</lyrics>
