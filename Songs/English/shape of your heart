<lyrics>[V1]
 Words and Music by Matt Crocker &amp; Joel Houston

[V2]
 VERSE 1
 There's a light hanging over me
 There's a beam running way down
 Turning sorrow to ecstasy
 As the dust comes to life

[V3]
 PRE-CHORUS
 See the shape of Your heart
 Where the margins collide
 There's a life hanging over me, over me
 Where Your love crossed the lines

[V4]
 VERSE 2
 There's a love hanging over me
 There's a beam running way out
 In the shadow of mystery
 Where my soul comes alive

[V5]
 CHORUS
 You run deep like the wildest heavens
 You run deep like the wild in me
 You run wide like the four horizons
 You run wide enough to cover me

[V6]
 POST-CHORUS
 How I love You Jesus
 I will worship You
 I will worship You Jesus
 Higher than anything
 I see More than the air I breathe
 I need You

[V7]
 VERSE 3
 There's a cross hanging over me
 There's a fire burning inside out
 As the Word comes to life in me
 In the shape of Your heart</lyrics>
