<lyrics>[V1]
.     Dm      A        Dm
 God rest ye merry, gentlemen;
.    Bb             A
 Let nothing you dismay
.  Dm       A         Dm
 Remember Christ our Savior
.    Bb                A
 Was born on Christmas Day
.   Gm                F       Dm
 To save us all from Satan's pow'r
.     Bb             C7
 When we were gone a-stray

[C1]
.    F          A           Dm
   O tidings of comfort and joy,
.               C
   Comfort and joy!
.  C7 F          Dm  A      Dm
   O  tidings of comfort and joy

[V2]
.   Dm     A       Dm
 In Bethlehem, in Israel,
.     Bb               A
 This blessed Babe was born,
.     Dm      A    Dm
 And laid within a manger
.  Bb              A
 Upon this blessed morn;
.    Gm       F      Dm
 Of which His Mother Mar-y
.    Bb              C7
 Did nothing take in scorn.

[V3]
.      Dm      A       Dm
 From God our heav'nly Father,
.  Bb            A
 A blessed angel came;
.     Dm    A     Dm
 And unto certain shepherds
.        Bb             A
 Brought tidings of the same;
.     Gm           F       Dm
 How that in Bethlehem was born
.    Bb            C7
 The Son of God by name.</lyrics>
