 You are the Almighty God and King.
 In the world there is no one like You.
 You are just, faithful, and righteous forever.
 You created everything, Lord -
 in the heavens and on earth.
 All is managed wisely - Life is in Your hand.

[P1]
   Who is so holy and just,
   Invariable and great?

[C1]
   This is our God - the Almighty King,
   Our God - the Creator Omnipresent,
   Our God - Wise and Powerful Lord
   Above us.
   This is our God - salvation for sinners,
   Our God - Love and Hope,
   Our God - Great and Wonderful Lord
   Above us.

[V2]
 You loved us from the beginning
 And to You we are reconciled
 Through Christ, His holy blood.
 You brought us into your kingdom,
 The true path we have.
 Sparing us from the power of darkness,

[B1]
   You have given freedom.
   Who is so holy and just,
   Invariable and great?
   Who is the truth and the life?
   Who saved us, sins forgave?</lyrics>
