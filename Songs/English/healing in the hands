<title>Healing In The Hands</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 My savior come, my savior come
 My father how my heart is longing for your love
 My savior breath, my savior breath
 My father breath your breath of life back into me
 For I know... where I find my home

[V2]
 There is healing in the hands of our god, of our god
 There is healing in his mighty hands of grace
 Yes, there is mercy in the one who is love, who is love
 There is mercy in the one who took my place
 My savior come

[V3]
 We bow our heads, humble and weak
 We come before the one who knows our every need
 We lift our hands, we cry your name
 Our hearts are broken by the way of all our shame
 Even so... we will not loose hope

[V4]
 There is healing in the hands of our god, of our god
 There is healing in his mighty hands of grace
 Yes, there is mercy in the one who is love, who is love
 There is mercy in the one who took my place
 My savior come, my savior come

[V5]
 You are the mighty one, you are the prince of peace
 My father you will long, the man to set me free
 You are the mighty one, you are the prince of peace
 My father you will long, will rescue me

[V6]
 There is healing in the hands of our god, of our god
 There is healing in his mighty hands of grace
 Yes, there is mercy in the one who is loved, who is loved
 There is mercy in the one who took my place
 My savior come, my savior come, my savior come</lyrics>
