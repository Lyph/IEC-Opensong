 There's no one, there's no one like Jesus
 There's no one, there's no one like Jesus
 There's no one, there's no one like Jesus
 There's no one, there's no one like Him

[V2]
 I walk I walk, here and there
 I search I search, everywhere
 I turn around, here and there
 There's no one, there's no one like Him.

[V3]
 You came to earth, a world to save
 Was crucified then rose again
 You've taken all my sin and shame
 There's no one, there's no none like Him

[V4]
 And one day soon, you'll come again
 And take us home to be with Him
 And we will all forever sing
 There's no one, there's no one like Him.</lyrics>
