.       G           D      C           G         D        C
 Men of faith, rise up and sing of the great and glorious King
.        G           D        C             G     D        C
 You are strong when you feel weak, in your brokenness, complete.

[C1]
.  G            C             D      G           C            D
   Shout to the north and the south! Sing to the east and the west!
.  Em       C         D    C       D          G
   Jesus is Savior to all, Lord of heaven and earth!

[V2]
.        G     D      C                G       D      C
 Rise up women of the truth; stand and sing to broken hearts,
.        G        D       C            G        D       C
 Who can know the healing power of our glorious King of love?

[B1]
.  Em                       C
   We've been through fire, we've been through rain;
.  Em                        C
   We've been refined by the pow'r of His name;
.  Em                  C
   We've fallen deeper in love with You;
.                    G/B          Dsus D
   You've burned the truth on our lips.

[V3]
.        G           D      C                G          D      C
 Rise up church with broken wings; fill this place with songs again
.       G       D         C            G      D          C
 Of our God who reigns on high; by His grace again we'll fly.</lyrics>
