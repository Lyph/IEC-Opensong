.           Bb                 Eb           Bb
 You're the Lion of Judah, the Lamb Who was slain,
.                           Eb             F
 You ascended to heaven and evermore shall reign;
.       Bb                      Eb          Bb
 At the end of the age when the earth You reclaim,
.                              F
 You will gather the nations before You.
.                                                          Eb   F
 And the eyes of all men will be fixed on the Lamb Who was crucified,
.                                                       Eb       F
 For with wisdom and mercy and justice He reigns at the Father's side.

[V2]
.          Bb                       Eb           Bb
 There's a shield in our hand and a sword at our side,
.                                  Eb          F
 There's a fire in our spirit that cannot be denied;
.       Bb                     Eb             Bb
 As the Father has told us for these you have died,
.                              F
 For the nations will gather before you.
.                                                         Eb   F
 And the ears of all men need to hear of the Lamb Who was crucified,
.                                                             Eb       F
 Who went down to the grave yet was raised up to reign at the Father's side.

[C1]
.          Bb                Eb   Bb  F
   And the angels will cry, &quot;Hail the Lamb
.          Bb                   Eb   Bb F
   Who was slain for the world; rule in power!&quot;
.          Bb                  Eb  Bb    F
   And the earth shall reply, &quot;You shall reign
.         Bb                        Eb      F   Bb
   As the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords!&quot;</lyrics>
