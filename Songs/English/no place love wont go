 Don't know how I wound up here
 Don't know where it all went wrong
 I bought into the lies
 And nearly lost it all
 But in the midst of fear
 His [?] voice I hear
 Telling me I'm worthy
 Saying that just for me

[V2]
 Love will walk through any storm
 Will see you through it all
 Oh, can it be there's no place love won't go
 As hopeless as it seems
 No, you're not out of reach
 To set you free
 There's no place love won't go

[V3]
 I know you're a lot like me
 And I know that it's hard to see
 There is a greater plan
 When you don't understand
 You're not a victim of
 The pain you can outrun
 Cause He took your burden
 And He came to set you free

[V4]
 Love will walk through any storm
 Will see you through it all
 Oh, can it be there's no place love won't go
 As hopeless as it seems
 No, you're not out of reach
 To set you free
 There's no place love won't go

[V5]
 Cause your God, He longs to meet you
 No matter where you are
 His arms are gonna reach you
 You never gone too far

[V6]
 Love will walk through any storm
 Will see you through it all
 Oh, can it be there's no place love won't go
 As hopeless as it seems
 No, you're not out of reach
 To set you free
 There's no place love won't go
 [Repeat]

[V7]
 He's gonna lift you out
 He's gonna pull you up
 He's gonna lead you home
 No place that love won't go
 [Repeat]</lyrics>
