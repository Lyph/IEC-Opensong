<lyrics>[V1]
 I was buried beneath my shame
 Who could carry that kind of weight
 It was my tomb
 Till I met You

[V2]
 I was breathing, but not alive
 All my failures I tried to hide
 It was my tomb
 Till I met You

[C1]
   You called my name and I ran out of that grave
   Out of the darkness into Your glorious day
   You called my name and I ran out of that grave
   Out of the darkness into Your glorious day

[V3]
 Now Your mercy has saved my soul
 Now Your freedom is all I know
 The old made new
 Jesus, when I met You

[C2]
   You called my name and I ran out of that grave
   Out of the darkness into Your glorious day
   You called my name and I ran out of that grave
   Out of the darkness into Your glorious day

[B1]
   I needed rescue my sin was heavy
   But chains break at the weight of Your glory
   I needed shelter I was an orphan
   But You call me a citizen of heaven
   When I was broken You were my healing
   Your love is the air that I'm breathing
   I have a future my eyes are open
   'Cause when You called my name

[C3]
   I ran out of that grave
   Out of the darkness into Your glorious day
   You called my name and I ran out of that grave
   Out of the darkness into Your glorious day</lyrics>
