 Oh Lord, You know each heart and search each soul
 For what it holds You know.
 Oh Lord, you hear each fault, the very plot
 Of stories untold. You know.

[C1]
   You are creator, our life's sustainer.
   You are creator of all.
   You are creator, our life's sustainer.
   God knows all.

[V2]
 Oh Lord, You formed us from the dust of the ground.
 Your breath of love made us.
 Oh Lord, You see us rise and when we fall
 You call us home. You know.

[C2]
   You are creator, our life's sustainer.
   You are creator of all.
   You are creator, our life's sustainer.
   God knows all.

[B1]
   He knows the numbers of hair on your head.
   He knows just what you're thinking.
   He knows just who you are.
   He formed you in the inmost hearts.
   He made your every make-up.
   He knows just who you are.
   But do you know who He is?

[C3]
   You are creator, our life's sustainer.
   You are creator of all.
   You are creator, our life's sustainer.</lyrics>
