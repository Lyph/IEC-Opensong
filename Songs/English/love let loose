<lyrics>[V1]
 Like a rushing wind, You came to give me life within
 And then the walls in me came falling down

[V2]
 Like a wildfire, Your love has started war inside
 And now I've never seen, me so alive

[P1]
   With Your love in my heart and hope in my veins
   I'm seeing the world through the eyes of my faith
   'Til everyone sees there is hope found in Your name

[C1]
   Your love let loose in me
   Your love let loose in me

[V3]
 Like a wildfire, Your love has started war inside
 And now I've never seen, me so alive

[P2]
   With Your love in my heart and hope in my veins
   I'm seeing the world through the eyes of my faith
   'Til everyone sees there is hope found in Your name!

[C2]
   Your love let loose in me
   Your love let loose in me
   Woah, I've never seen me so alive
   Your love, Your love, it makes the best of me
   Woah, I've never seen me so alive
   Your love let loose in me

[P3]
   With Your love in my heart and hope in my veins
   I'm seeing the world through the eyes of my faith
   'Til everyone sees there is hope found in Your name!

[C3]
   Your love let loose in me
   Your love let loose in me
   Woah, I've never seen me so alive
   Your love, Your love, it makes the best of me
   Woah, I've never seen me so alive
   Your love let loose in me!</lyrics>
