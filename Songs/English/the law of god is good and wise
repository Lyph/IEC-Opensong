<lyrics>[V1]
 The law of God is good and wise, And sets His will before our eyes, Shows us the way of righteousness, And dooms to death when we transgress.

[V2]
 Its light of holiness imparts The knowledge of our sinful hearts, That we may see our lost estate And seek deliv'rance ere too late.

[V3]
 To those who help in Christ have found And would in works of love abound It shows what deeds are His delight And should be done as good and right.

[V4]
 When men the offered help disdain And willfully in sin remain, Its terror in their ear resounds And keeps their wickedness in bounds.

[V5]
 The law is good, but since the fall Its holiness condemns us all; It dooms us for our sin to die And has no pow'r to justify.</lyrics>
