 VERSE
.       Bm         D G
 This one thing I'm asking
. G             D   A
 One thing I'm needing
.     Bm             D G          G     D    A
 A moment that's passing is not what I'm seeking

[V2]
 PRECHORUS
.          Em
 Like it's air that I'm breathing
 I want your presence
.G
 Feet on the earth
 Heart full of heaven

[V3]
 CHORUS
.Bm    D            G
 Zeal for You completely consumes me
.D
 I can't get enough
.A
 Can't get enough of
.Bm          D   G
 You, The fire burning right through me
.   D
 I can't get enough
. A
 Can't get enough of You

[V4]
 VERSE
.   Bm      D G
 I'm after Your Spirit
. G   D   A
 More than a feeling
.  Bm      D  G
 I don't need a reason
.  G      D     A
 To keep chasing who You are

[V5]
 BRIDGE
.   G             D
 Every beat is yours
 You can have it all
.G   D      Bm   A
 Take over like only You can
.G       D
 All I'm reaching for
 You and nothing more
.G   D      Bm   A
 Take over like only You can</lyrics>
