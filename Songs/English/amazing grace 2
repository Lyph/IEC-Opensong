.E                    A        E
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
.                         B7
 That saved a wretch like me;
.   E        E7        A       E
 I once was lost, but now am found,
.                B7    A  E
 Was blind, but now I see.

[V2]
.E                           A        E
 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
.                      B7
 And grace my fears relieved;
.     E       E7         A      E
 How precious did that grace appear,
.            B7      A   E
 The hour I first believed!

[V3]
.E                      A          E
 Through many dangers, toils and snares
.                B7
 I have already come;
.      E           E7        A         E
 'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
.                B7      A  E
 And grace will lead me home.

[V4]
.E                           A        E
 When we've been there ten thousand years,
.                       B7
 Bright shining as the Sun,
.      E       E7       A          E
 We've no less days to sing God's praise
.              B7      A  E
 Than when we first begun.</lyrics>
