<lyrics>[V1]
 Our God, our help in ages past, Our hope for years to come, Our shelter from the stormy blast, And our eternal home.

[V2]
 Under the shadow of Thy throne Thy saints have dwelt secure; Sufficient is Thine arm alone, And our defense is sure.

[V3]
 Before the hills in order stood, Or earth received her frame, From everlasting Thou art God, To endless years the same.

[V4]
 Thy Word commands our flesh to dust, 'Return, ye sons of men:' All nations rose from earth at first, And turn to earth again.

[V5]
 A thousand ages in Thy sight Are like an evening gone; Short as the watch that ends the night Before the rising sun.

[V6]
 The busy tribes of flesh and blood,
 With all their lives and cares,
 Are carried downwards by the flood,
 And lost in following years.

[V7]
 Time, like an ever rolling stream,
 Bears all its sons away;
 They fly, forgotten, as a dream
 Dies at the opening day.

[V8]
 Like flowery fields the nations stand
 Pleased with the morning light;
 The flowers beneath the mower's hand
 Lie withering ere 'tis night.

[V9]
 Our God, our help in ages past,
 Our hope for years to come,
 Be Thou our guard while troubles last,
 And our eternal home.</lyrics>
