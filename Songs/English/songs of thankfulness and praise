<lyrics>[V1]
 Songs of thankfulness and praise, Jesus, Lord, to Thee we raise, Manifested by the star To the sages from afar; Branch of royal David's stem In Thy birth at Bethlehem; Anthems be to Thee addressed, God in man made manifest.

[V2]
 Manifest at Jordan's stream, Prophet, Priest, and King supreme; And at Cana, wedding guest, In Thy Godhead manifest; Manifest in pow'r divine, Changing water into wine; Anthems be to Thee addressed, God in man made manifest.

[V3]
 Manifest in making whole Palsied limbs and fainting soul; Manifest in valiant fight, Quelling all the devil's might; Manifest in gracious will, Ever bringing good from ill; Anthems be to Thee addressed, God in man made manifest.

[V4]
 Sun and moon shall darkened be, Stars shall fall, the heav'ns shall flee, Christ will then like lightning shine, All will see His glorious sign: All will then the trumpet hear; All will see the Judge appear; Thou by all wilt be confessed, God in man made manifest.

[V5]
 Grant us grace to see Thee, Lord, Mirrored in Thy holy Word; May we imitate Thee now, And be pure, as pure art Thou; That we like to Thee may be At Thy great Epiphany; And may praise Thee, ever blest, God in man made manifest.</lyrics>
