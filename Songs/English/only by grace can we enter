 Only by grace can we enter
 Only by grace can we stand
 Not by our human endeavor
 But by the blood of the lamb
 Into your presence You call us
 You call us to come
 Into your presence You draw us
 And now by your grace we come
 Now by your grace we come

[C1]
   Lord if you mark our transgressions
   Who will stand
   Thanks to your grace
   We are cleansed by the blood of the lamb
   Lord if you mark our transgressions
   Who will stand
   Thanks to your grace
   We are cleansed by the blood of the lamb</lyrics>
