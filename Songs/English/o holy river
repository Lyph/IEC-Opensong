<title>O Holy River</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 O holy river
 Flow into my garden, flow
 Soaking, soaking this thirsty ground
 Flow, with blessings
 From the springs of wisdom
 To the shores of righteousness
 Flow with blessings
 From the springs of wisdom
 To the shores of righteousness
 Flow with bountiful life

[V2]
 O holy river
 Flow into my garden, flow
 Leaf by leaf, restoring life
 Flow, with blessings
 From the springs of wisdom
 To the shores of righteousness
 Flow with blessings
 From the springs of wisdom
 To the shores of righteousness
 Flow with bountiful life

[V3]
 O holy river
 Flow into my garden, flow
 Cleansing, cleansing each hidden place
 Flow with blessings
 From the springs of wisdom
 To the shores of righteousness
 Flow with blessings
 From the springs of wisdom
 To the shores of righteousness
 Flow with bountiful life
 O holy river</lyrics>
