 We've come to praise You
 'Cause You're worthy
 Nobody like You in Your glory
 We love to praise You
 'Cause You're holy, awesome
 Wonderful, mighty God

[V2]
 And everything that You do
 Comes from a heart of love
 And a hand of mercy
 For You are faithful and true
 Working all things for good
 For those who love You

[V3]
 For if God in love did not spare His Son
 But He gave Him up for His chosen ones
 How much more will He freely give to us
 Who call upon His name?
 Who call upon His name?
 Who call upon His name?
 Who call upon His name?</lyrics>
