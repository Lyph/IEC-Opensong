 Hark, the glad sound! the Savior comes! The Sa-vior promised long; Let every heart prepare a throne, And every voice a song.

[V2]
 On Him the Spirit, largely poured, Exertsits sacred Fire; Wisdom and might, and zeal and love, His holy Breast inspire.

[V3]
 He comes the pris'ners to release, In Sa-tan's bondage held; The gates of brass before Him burst, The iron fetters yield.

[V4]
 He comes from thickest films of vice To clearthe mental ray, And on the eyeballs of the blind To pour celestial day.

[V5]
 He comes the broken heart to bind, The bleed-ing soul to cure; And with the treasures of His grace T'enrich the humble poor.

[V6]
 His silver trumpets publish loud
 The jub'lee of the Lord
 Our debts are all remitted now
 Our heritage restored.

[V7]
 Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,
 Thy welcome shall proclaim;
 And Heav'n's eternal arches ring
 With Thy belov√®d name.</lyrics>
