<lyrics>[V1]
 I'm gonna trust in God
 I'm gonna trust in Jesus
 without shame and without fear.
 I'm gonna fix my eyes
 On the hope of glory
 For His day is drawing near.

[V2]
 How great is the love of God
 How steady is His hand
 To guide me through this world.
 And though I am weak, in Him I stand
 And you will hear me say today
 In faith, I'm gonna trust in God.

[V3]
 Now when the cares of life
 Seem overwhelming
 And my heart is sinking down
 I'm gonna lift my hands
 To the One who'll help me
 To the One who holds my crown.</lyrics>
