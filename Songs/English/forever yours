 [Verse 1]
 I will wait on You, Lord
 I will wait on You, Lord
 I'm not going anywhere
 So I will wait on You, Lord

[V2]
 [Pre-Chorus]
 I'm tearing down this fortress I've built
 Nothing would keep us apart
 You hold the heavens but never let go of my heart!

[V3]
 [Chorus 1]
 I'm forever Yours!
 I'm forever Yours!
 Oh, the greatest joy
 You'll always be mine
 I'm forever Yours!
 Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooohh
 Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-oooohh
 I'm forever Yours
 Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooohh
 Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-oooohh</lyrics>
