 VERSE 1
 Trouble won't throw me
 Won't break me
 Won't scare me
 No more
 Fear must have thought I was faithless
 When it came for my heart

[V3]
 PRE-CHORUS 1
 'Cause I got a song that will never die
 I know Your love is the reason why

[V4]
 CHORUS 1
 I'll sing the night into the morning
 I'll sing the fear into Your praise
 I'll sing my soul into Your presence
 Whenever I say Your Name
 Let the devil know not today

[V5]
 VERSE 2
 Tell me did the enemy panic
 As You took up that cross
 Tell me did the darkness cry mercy
 As You rolled back that rock

[V6]
 PRE-CHORUS 2
 'Cause I know Your life is the life in mine
 I know Your love is the reason why

[V7]
 CHORUS 2
 I'll sing the night into the morning
 I'll sing the fear into Your praise
 I'll sing my soul into Your presence
 Whenever I say Your Name
 Let the devil know not today
 Whenever I say Your Name Jesus
 Let the devil know not today
 Not now not ever again

[V8]
 BRIDGE
 Your love stood down death
 Crushed the devil's head
 Fear is just a liar
 Running out of breath
 The fight beneath Your feet
 I'm standing on Jesus' Name
 So let the devil know not today
 Let the devil know not today No no
 Not now not ever again Jesus
 Let the devil know not today</lyrics>
