<lyrics>[V1]
 Be not dismayed whate'er betide, God will take care of you; Beneath His wings of love abide, God will take care of you. God will take care of you, through ev'ry day, o'er all the way; He will take care of you, God will take care of you.

[V2]
 Through days of toil when heart doth fail, God will take care of you; When dangers fierce your path assail, God will take care of you. God will take care of you, through ev'ry day, o'er all the way; He will take care of you, God will take care of you.

[V3]
 All you may need He will provide, God will take care of you; Nothing you ask will be denied, God will take care of you. God will take care of you, through ev'ry day, o'er all the way; He will take care of you, God will take care of you.

[V4]
 No matter what may be the test, God will take care of you; Lean, weary one, upon His breast, God will take care of you. God will take care of you, through ev'ry day, o'er all the way; He will take care of you, God will take care of you.</lyrics>
