<lyrics>[V1]
 VERSE
.         D
 I have been here before
.        E               F#m    C#m
 But I know there is more of You to find
.     D
 I have seen Heaven fall
.       E                  F#m  C#m
 Still my heart longs to see You one more time

[V2]
 PRECHORUS
.     E                    F#m
 So once again, I invite You in
.         D
 Once again I am reaching out

[V3]
 CHORUS
. A
 You're all I'm after
.E
 All that I pursue
.  F#m
 I hunger and thirst for You
. D
 Hunger and thirst for You
.A
 My sole desire
.Bm
 No one else will do
.   F#m
 I hunger and thirst for You
. D
 Hunger and thirst for You

[V4]
 VERSE
.       D
 There are prayers I have prayed
.       E         F#m    C#m
 Still echoing even in the wait
.     D
 But the hope I embrace
.      E                 F#m  C#m
 Is that You are good and You will make a way

[V5]
 BRIDGE
.                A                      E
 All that I'm needing, All that I'm seeking
.             F#m            D
 All that I want, Is all that are
.           A                  E
 My one devotion, You and You only
.       F#m             D
 All that I want, Is all that are</lyrics>
