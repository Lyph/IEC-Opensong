 // The conquering Lion
 Shall break every chain
 He will wipe every tear away
 He will take all my hurt and my pain //

[C1]
   // He will lead me to springs of living water
   He will lead me to springs of living water
   He will lead me to springs of living water
   He will shepherd me //

[B1]
   And the Lord, He will come to us
   With a strong hand and mighty outstretched arm
   And the Lord, He will shepherd us,
   And the Lord, He will lead us to
   Fountains of living water, fountains of living water</lyrics>
