<title>Michael Row the Boat Ashore</title>
<lyrics>[C1]
   Michael, row the boat ashore, Hallelujah
   Michael, row the boat ashore, Hallelujah

[V1]
 Jordan's river is deep and wide, Hallelujah
 Milk and honey on the other side, Hallelujah

[V2]
 Sister, help to trim the sail, Hallelujah
 Sister, help to trim the sail, Hallelujah

[V3]
 Jordan's river is chilly and cold, Hallelujah
 Chills the body but not the soul, Hallelujah</lyrics>
