.Em7           D/F#      G
 There must be more than this
.C           Em7      D/F#      C
 O breath of God come breathe within
.Em7           D/F#      G
 There must be more than this
.C         Em7    D/F#     G
 Spirit of God we wait for You

 Fill us anew we pray, fill us anew we pray

[C1]
.            G             D/F#
   Consuming fire fan into flame
.    Em7              C
   A passion for Your name
.            G                D/F#
   Spirit of God fall in this place
.                 Em7
   Lord have Your way
.                 D        C
   Lord have Your way with us

[V2]
 Come like a rushing wind
 Clothe us with power from on high
 Now set the captives free
 Leave us abandoned to Your praise
 Lord let Your glory fall, Lord let Your glory fall

[B1]
.  C
   Stir it up in our hearts Lord
.  D
   Stir it up in our hearts
.  Em
   Stir it up in our hearts
.  G
   A passion for Your name</lyrics>
