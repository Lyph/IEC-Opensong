<lyrics>[V1]
 I wonder if I'll ever find my way
 I wonder if my life could really change
 At all

[V2]
 All this earth
 Could all that is lost ever be found
 Could a garden come up from this ground
 At all

[C1]
   You make beaytiful things
   You make beaytiful things out of the dust
   You make beaytiful things
   You make beaytiful things out of us

[V3]
 All around
 Hope is sringing up from this old ground
 Out of chaos life is being found
 In You

[B1]
   You make me new You are making me new
   You make me new You are making me new</lyrics>
