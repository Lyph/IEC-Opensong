 Verse 1:
.G#                      D#
 The moon and stars they wept
.                    Fm
 The morning sun was dead
.                   C#
 The Savior of the world was fallen
.G#               D#
 His body on the cross
.                     Fm
 His blood poured out for us
.                    C#
 The weight of every curse upon Him

 Verse 2:
.G#                  D#
 One final breath He gave
.                  Fm
 As Heaven looked away
.                C#
 The Son of God was laid in darkness
.G#               D#
 A battle in the grave
.                     Fm
 The war on death was waged
.             C#
 The power of hell forever broken

[C1]
   Chorus:
.  G#                   D#
   The ground began to shake
.                        Fm
   The stone was rolled away
.                          C#
   His perfect love could not be overcome
.  G#/C                     D#
   Now death where is your sting
.                  Fm
   Our resurrected King
.                     C#
   Has rendered you defeated
.   G#        D#
   Forever, He is glorified
.   Fm            C#
   Forever, He is lifted high
.    G#           D#
   Forever, He is risen
.           Fm            C#
   He is alive; He is alive</lyrics>
