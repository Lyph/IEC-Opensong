.C#m          A
 How do you explain,
.             C#m
 How do you describe,
.                      A
 A love that goes from East to West
.B                         C#m
 And runs as deep as it is wide?

[P1]
.                   A                             C#m
   You know all our hopes. Lord, You know all our fears.
.                    A                  B
   And words cannot express the love we feel,
.                         C#m
   But we long for You to hear.

[C1]
.                   A
   So listen to our hearts,
.                   C#m
   hear our spirits sing
.                        A
   A song of praise that flows
.       B              E
   from those You have redeemed.
.                  A
   We will use the words we know
.     B                  E     B       C#m
   To tell You what an awesome God You are.
.                     A
   But words are not enough
.                     B
   To tell You of our love,
.                   E
   So listen to our hearts

[V2]
.C#m                      A
 If words could fall like rain
.                   C#m
 From these lips of mine,
.               A              B
 And if I had a thousand years,
.                         C#m
 I would still run out of time.
.                    A
 If You listen to my heart,
.                C#m
 every beat will say,
.                   A
 &quot;Thank You for the life,
.                  B
 thank You for the truth,
.                  C#m
 Thank You for the way.&quot;

[B1]
.  E              A                        B
   Words are not enough to tell You of our love,
.     B7            E
   So listen to our hearts.</lyrics>
