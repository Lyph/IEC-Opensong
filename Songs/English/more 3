<lyrics>[V1]
.F                  Am       C
 Take a look at the mountain,
 stretching a mile high.
.F                  Am    C
 Take a look at the ocean,
.                    Bbmaj7
 far as your eye can see,
.    F/A
 And think of Me.

[V2]
.F                  Am     C
 Take a look at the desert.
 Do you feel like a grain of sand?
.F                 Am   C
 I am with you wherever;
.                        Bb
 where you go is where I am.

[P1]
.                 Ab          Bb
   And I'm always thinking of you.
.         Ab          Bb
   Take a look around you;
.      Ab          Bb         F
   I'm spelling it out one by one.

[C1]
.    N.C.     C5
   I love you more than the sun
.          F2(no3)                    Am
   And the stars that I taught how to shine.
.                        F
   You are Mine, and you shine for Me too.
.            C5               F2(no3)
   I love you yesterday and today and tomorrow;
.       Am                G
   I'll say it again and again:
.         F2(no3) Am   C(F2(no3)AmCtoverses)
   I love you     more.

[V3]
 Just a face in the city,
 just a tear on a crowded street.
 But you are one in a million,
 and you belong to Me.

[P2]
.        Ab          Bb
   And I want you to know
.           Ab          Bb
   that I'm not letting go,
.  Ab        Bb         F
   Even when you come undone.

[B1]
.  Dm        C/E F2(no3)        C
   Shine for Me.  You shine for Me.
.  Dm            C/E         Ab              Bb
   You shine on. You shine on. You shine for Me.

[C2]
.             D5
   I love you more than the sun
.          G2(no3)                    Bm
   And the stars that I taught how to shine.
.                        G
   You are mine, and you shine for me too.
.            D5               G2(no3)
   I love you yesterday and today and tomorrow;
.       Bm                 A
   I'll say it again and again:
.             D5
   I love you more than the sun
.          G2(no3)                    Bm

   You are mine, and you shine for me too.
.            D5               G2(no3)                      Bm
   I love you yesterday and today, through the joy and the pain,
.                         A
   I'll say it again and again:

[B2]
.         G2(no3) Bm   D
   I love you     more.
.         G2(no3) Bm
   I love you     more.
.  D
    
.  G2(no3) Bm  D
    And I  see you, and I made you,
.  G2(no3) Bm   D.                     G      Bm
    And I  love you more than you can imagine,
.  D                 G
   More than you can fathom.
.  Bm D                  G   Bm
    I love you more than the sun,
.  D                G   BmD
   and you shine for Me.</lyrics>
