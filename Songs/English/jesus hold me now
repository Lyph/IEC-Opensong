<lyrics>[V1]
 Living on my own, thinking for myself
 Castles in the sand, temporary wealth
 Now the walls are falling down now the storms are closing in
 And here I am again

[C1]
   Jesus, hold me now I need to feel You in this place
   To know You're by my side and hear Your voice tonight
   Jesus, hold me now I long for Your embrace
   I'm beat and broken down I can't find my way out

[V2]
 Jesus, hold me now
 Jesus, hold me now

[V3]
 Curse this morning sun, drags me into one more day
 Of reaping what I've sown, living with my shame
 Welcome to my world, and the life that I have made
 One day you're a prince, and the next day you're a slave

[B1]
   Lord, I just looked up today
   And realized how far away
   I am from where You are
   I don't know what else to pray
   Broken at Your feet I lay
   The life I've torn apart</lyrics>
