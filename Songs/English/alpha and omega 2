<lyrics>[V1]
 I Heard a great voice out of heaven saying
 Behold the tabernacle of God is with men
 He shall dwell within them and they shall be His people
 And Almighty God will be with them

[V2]
 He shall wipe away all tears from their eyes
 There shall be no more death
 Neither sorrow, nor crying, and no more pain
 The former things are all passed away

[V3]
 He that sat upon the throne said,
 &quot;Behold, I make all things new&quot;
 He said unto me, &quot;Write these words
 For they are faithful and true&quot;

[V4]
 And it is done
 It is done
 It is done
 It is done

[V5]
 He is the Alpha and Omega
 The Beginning and the End
 The Son of God, the King of Kings
 Lord of lords, He's Everything
 Messiah, Jehovah
 The Prince of Peace is He
 The Son of Man, Seed of Abraham
 Second Person in the Trinity</lyrics>
