 A7sus4    D                         G        A
 O Church arise and put your armour on
 D       G              A    G
 Hear the call of Christ our captain
 A7sus4 D G A
 For now the weak can say that they are strong
 D G A G
 With the strength that God has given
 G D A
 With shield of faith and belt of truth
 D G D Bm A
 We'll stand against the devil's lies
 Asus4 D G A
 An army bold whose battle cry is love
 D G A D
 Reaching out to those in darkness
 (same chords for rest of song)

[V2]
 Our call to war, to love the captive soul
 But to rage against the captor
 And with the sword that makes the wounded whole
 We will fight with faith and valourWhen faced with trials on every side
 We know the outcome is secure
 And Christ will have the prize for which He died
 An inheritance of nations

[C1]
   D A Em
   Oh.....

[V3]
 Come, see the cross where love and mercy meet
 As the Son of God is stricken
 And see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet
 For the Conqueror has risen
 And as the stone is rolled away
 And Christ emerges from the grave
 This victory march continues 'til the day
 Every eye and heart shall see Him

[V4]
 So Spirit, come put strength in every stride
 Give grace for every hurdle
 That we may run with faith to win the prize
 Of a servant good and faithful
 As saints of old still line the way
 Retelling triumphs of His grace
 We hear their call and hunger for the day
 When with Christ we stand in glory
