<lyrics>[V1]
 Your faith can move the mountains
 Let the Mountains move
 We come with expectation
 We're waiting here for You, waiting here for You

[V2]
 You're the Lord of all creation
 And still You know my heart
 The Author of salvation
 You've Loved me from the start

[C1]
   Waiting here for you
   With our hands lifted high in praise
   And it's You we adore
   Singing Hallelujah

[V3]
 You are everything You promised
 Your faithfulness is true
 And we're Desperate for Your presence
 All we need is You

[B1]
   Hallelujah, Hallelujah
   We're singing, Hallelujah
   We're singing, Hallelujah</lyrics>
