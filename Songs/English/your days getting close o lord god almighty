 Your day's getting close - o Lord, God Almighty,
 When all nations will come before You,
 2X: With trump of archangels and angel shouting
 You will gather all nations, who trust onto You.

[V2]
 As on days before flood people ate, drank, got married -
 Didn't think that the end to their life'll ever come -
 2X: But God opened sky's windows, and pour rain from heaven,
 Killing everything that had a breath in their lungs.

[V3]
 Like Sodom and Gomorra, having bad passion,
 Who fomented shameful fire among themselves,
 2X: Refusing the law of God's ultimate power -
 Tasted God's wrath themselves at this terrible day.

[V4]
 Two workers at that day will work at the same field -
 One of them would be carried to Jesus by clouds,
 2X: But it will be too late for the other to repent -
 He deserved to be fairly punished by God.

[V5]
 In the blink of the eye Christ will return here
 For the people, who did stay loyal to Him,
 2X: And He'll say: «loyal slave, enter your Master's kingdom
 You are worthy to be celebrating with Me»

[V6]
 After some time of rest people'll raise up for torments,
 To be judged by the Christ with the rest of alive,
 2X: Even those, who are brave will shout out fear, seeing Great God,
 All the people will cry seeing Fearsome Lord Christ.

[V7]
 Your day's getting close - o Lord, God Almighty,
 When all nations will come before You,
 2X: With trump of archangels and angel shouting
 You will gather all nations, who trust onto You.</lyrics>
