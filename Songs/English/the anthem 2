 By His stripes we are healed
 By His nail pierced hands we're free
 By His blood we're washed clean
 Now we have the victory

[P1]
   The power of sin is broken
   Jesus overcame it all
   He has won our freedom
   Jesus has won it all

[C1]
   Hallelujah You have won the victory
   Hallelujah You have won it all for me
   Death could not hold You down You are the risen King
   Seated in majesty You are the risen King

[B1]
   Our God has risen
   He is alive
   He won the victory
   He reigns on high</lyrics>
