<lyrics>[V1]
 Despair not, O heart, in thy sorrow, But hope from God's promises borrow Beware in thy sorrow, of sinning For death is of life the beginning.

[V2]
 The body is shrouded in mourning; The garlands, the casket adorning, Are emblems of hope that betoken, O Death, that thy power is broken.

[V3]
 A dearly belov'd one hath left us; God hath in His Wisdom bereft us; But He will not leave us forsaken,We know that the dead shall awaken.

[V4]
 When dawneth the glorious morrow, This body that we view with sorrow, A glorified form shall be given, Restored to its spirit in heaven.

[V5]
 The seed that in springtime is planted, Is hid in the ground, but if granted A measure of sunshine and showers, Will spring into fruitage and flowers;

[V6]
 A gift to the churchyard we tender,
 As dust to the dust we surrender;
 Returning the clay to its Maker,
 We lay it to rest in God's acre.

[V7]
 A soul in that body abided,
 A soul that in Jesus confided,
 A soul that hath longed for salvation,
 And now hath found hope's consummation.

[V8]
 O earth, we consign to thy keeping
 This body with sorrow and weeping;
 In peace to await resurrection,
 When it shall arise in perfection.

[V9]
 O Christ, our soul's Maker and Lover;
 When time and earth's travail are over,
 Thou closest the grave's mournful story,
 And callest Thine own to Thy glory.</lyrics>
