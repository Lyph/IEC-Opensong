<lyrics>[V1]
 Thank you for saving me;
 What can I say?
 You are my everything,
 I will sing Your praise.
 You shed Your blood for me;
 What can I say?
 You took my sin and shame,
 A sinner called by name.

[V2]
 Great is the Lord.
 Great is the Lord.
 For we know Your truth has set us free;
 You've set Your hope in me.

[V3]
 Mercy and grace are mine,
 Forgiven is my sin;
 Jesus my only hope,
 The Saviour of the world.
 &quot;Great is the Lord,&quot; we cry,
 God, let Your Kingdom come&quot;,
 Your word has let me see,
 Thank you for saving me.</lyrics>
