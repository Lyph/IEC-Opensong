 I've walked among the shadows
 You wiped my tears away
 And I've felt the pain of heartbreak
 And I've seen the brighter days
 And I've prayed prayers to heaven from my lowest place
 And I have held the blessings
 God, you give and take away

[B1]
   No matter what I have, Your grace is enough No matter where I am, I'm standing in Your love

[V2]
 On the mountains, I will bow my life To the one who set me there
 In the valley, I will lift my eyes to the one who sees me there
 When I'm standing on the mountain aft, didn't get there on my own
 When I'm walking through the valley end, no I am not alone!
 You're God of the hills and valleys! Hills and Valleys! God of the hills and valleys
 And I am not alone!</lyrics>
