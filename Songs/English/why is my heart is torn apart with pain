 Why is my heart is torn apart with pain
 And the sorrow doesn't let me see the light?
 Why does the fire of hate burn?
 Who can give me the answer?
 Still I know that the Lord is Great
 And according to His promise
 He wil give me the strengths for my earth walk
 And I will remain in His love.
 But that Day will answer all the questions of life,
 That Day will reveal us all reasons of sufferings.
 That Day will break through the sorrow,
 That Day will shine more than sun,
 In that Day I will see my Lord.</lyrics>
