 The angel Gabriel from heaven came, his wings as drifted snow, his eyes as flame; &quot;All hail,&quot; said he, &quot;thou lowly maiden, Mary, most highly favored lady,&quot; Gloria!

[V2]
 &quot;For know a blessed Mother thou shalt be, all generations laud and honor thee, thy Son shall be Emmanuel, by seers foretold, most highly favored lady,&quot; Gloria!

[V3]
 Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head, &quot;To me be as it pleaseth God,&quot; she said, &quot;my soul shall laud and magnify His holy Name.&quot; most highly favored lady,&quot; Gloria!

[V4]
 Of her, Emmanuel, the Christ was born in Bethlehem, all on a Christmas morn, and Christian folk throughout the world will ever say most highly favored lady,&quot; Gloria!</lyrics>
