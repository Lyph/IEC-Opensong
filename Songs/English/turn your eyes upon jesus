.  E         B         C#m E7
   Turn your eyes upon Je__sus,
.       A           F#m       B
   Look full in His wonderful face;
.          E         E7
   And the things of earth
.            A         Am/F#
   Will grow strangely dim
.         E            B7        E
   In the light of His glory and grace.</lyrics>
