 O You glorious One
 How matchless are You
 Come and see me as I am
 I am nothing without You
 Come and see me (3) as I am
 Come and see me (2)
 I am nothing without You

[V2]
 O You glorious One
 How matchless are your works
 Come and see my world as it is
 It is dark without You
 Come and see my world (3) as it is
 Come and see my world (2)
 It is dark without You

[V3]
 O You glorious One
 How matchless is your grace
 Come and take my hand, I am lost
 May I always rest in You
 Come and take my hand (3), I am lost
 Come and take my hand (2)
 May I always rest in You</lyrics>
