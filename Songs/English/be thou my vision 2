<lyrics>[V1]
.D          G         D       A  D
 Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart,
.A                  D     G         D    A
 Naught be all else to me save that Thou art;
.G                       D         G
 Thou my best thought by day or by night,
.D         G             Em          D
 Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

[V2]
 Be Thou my wisdom, be Thou my true Word,
 I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
 Thou my great Father, and I thy true son,
 Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

[B1]
.          G       D
   Open my eyes to see,
.                G        D
   Lord, bind my heart to thee.
.             G    A  Em
   I yield my life complete.
.             G      D
   Be thou my vision.

[V3]
 Be Thou my shield and my sword for the fight,
 Be Thou my dignity, be Thou my might;
 Thou my soul's shelter, and Thou my high tow'r,
 Raise Thou me heav'nward, O Pow'r of my pow'r.

[V4]
 Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise,
 Thou mine Inheritance now and always;
 Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
 High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

[V5]
 High King of heaven my victory won,
 May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heav'n's Sun;
 Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
 Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.</lyrics>
