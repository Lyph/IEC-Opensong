 In the bleak mid-winter, all creation groans
 For a world in darkness, frozen like a stone
 Light is breaking, in a stable for a throne

[C1]
   And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
   And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
   Unto us a child is born
   The King of kings and Lord of lords
   And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore

[V2]
 If I were a wise man, I would travel far
 And if I were a shepherd, I would do my part
 But poor as I am, I will give to Him my heart

[B1]
   Here within a manger lies
   The One who made the starry skies
   This baby born for sacrifice
   Christ, the Messiah
   Into our hopes, into our fears
   The Savior of the world appears
   The promise of eternal years
   Christ, the Messiah</lyrics>
