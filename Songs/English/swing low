.         D
   Swing low, sweet chariot,
.   D                      A7
   Comin' for to carry me home.
.         D    D7    G   D
   Swing low, sweet chariot,
.   Bm            G    A   D
   Comin' for to carry me home.

[V1]
.   D
 I looked over Jordan and what did I see,
. D                      A7
 Comin' for to carry me home?
.   D       D7      G              D
 A band of angels lookin' out for me,
. Bm            G    A   D
 Comin' for to carry me home.

[V2]
.   D
 If you get there before I do,
.D                      A7
 Comin' for to carry me home,
.       D    D7    G   D
 Tell all my friends I'm comin' too,
.Bm            G    A   D
 Comin' for to carry me home.

[V3]
.   D
 I'm sometimes up and sometimes down,
.D                      A7
 Comin' for to carry me home.
.       D    D7    G   D
 But still my soul is glory bound,
.Bm            G    A   D
 Comin' for to carry me home.</lyrics>
