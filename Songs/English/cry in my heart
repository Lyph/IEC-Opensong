.          D
 There's a cry in my heart
.         A
 For Your glory to fall,
.         Em                     A
 For Your presence to fill up my senses.
.          D
 There's a yearning again,
.  A
 A thirst for discipline,
.  Em                            A
 A hunger for things that are deeper.

[P1]
.            Bm      G
   Could You take me beyond?
.            D        A
   Could You carry me through?
.       Bm      G
   If I open my heart
.          D             A
   Could I go there with You?

[P2]
.           Bm        G
   For I've been here before,
.        D                  A
   But I know there's still more.
.      Bm              A
   Oh, Lord, I need to know You.

[C1]
.                G                         D
   For what do I have if I don't have You, Jesus?
.               A                   Bm
   What in this life could mean any more?
.             G                D
   You are my Rock. You are my Glory.
.              A            Bm
   You are the Lifter of my head.</lyrics>
