 Lord, I come before Your throne of grace;
 I find rest in Your presence, and fullness of joy.
 In worship and wonder I behold Your face,
 Singing what a faithful God have I.

[V2]
 What a faithful God have I,
 What a faithful God.
 What a faithful God have I,
 Faithful in every way.

[V3]
 Lord of mercy, You have heard my cry;
 Through the storm You're the beacon,
 My song in the night.
 In the shelter of Your wings,
 Hear my heart's reply,
 Singing what a faithful God have I.

[V4]
 Lord all sov'reign, granting peace from heav'n,
 Let me comfort those who suffer
 With the comfort You have given.

[V5]
 I will tell of Your great love
 For as long as I live,
 Singing what a faithful God have I.</lyrics>
