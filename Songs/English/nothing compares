<lyrics>[V1]
.A          E       F#m
 I've heard all the stories;
.A         E       F#m
 I've seen all the signs,
.A         E       F#m
 Witnessed all the glory,
.A      E          F#m
 Tasted all that's fine.

[C1]
.             A     E      Bm           D            A   E Bm
   Nothing compares to the greatness of knowing You, Lord.
.             A     E      Bm           D            A   E Bm
   Nothing compares to the greatness of knowing You, Lord.

[V2]
 I see all the people
 Wasting all their time,
 Building up their riches
 For a life that's fine.

[B1]
.        Bm               D            E   EsusE
   And I find myself just living for today,
.           Bm                D              E     EsusE
   'Cause I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring.
.        Bm          D                  A          E       G
   So no matter if I rise or fall, I'll never be alone, oh no...</lyrics>
