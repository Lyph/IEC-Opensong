<lyrics>[V1]
 All praise to Jesus' hallowed Name Who of virgin pure became True man for us! The angels sing As the glad news to earth they bring. Hallelujah!

[V2]
 Th'Eternal Father's only Son For a manger leaves His throne Disguised in our poor flesh and blood See now the everlasting Good.

[V3]
 He whom the world could not inwrap Yonder lies in Mary's lap; He is become an infant small, Who by His might upholdeth all.

[V4]
 Th'Eternal Light, come down from heav'n, Hath to us new sunshine giv'n; It shineth in the midst of night, And maketh us the sons of light.

[V5]
 The Father's Son, God ever\blest, In the world became a guest; He leads us from this vale of tears, And makes us in his kingdom heirs.

[V6]
 He came to earth so mean and poor, Man to pity and restore,
 And make us rich in heaven above, Equal with angels through his love.

[V7]
 All this He did to show His grace To our poor and sinful race;
 For this let Christendom adore And praise His name for evermore.</lyrics>
