<lyrics>[V1]
 Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee! E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me, Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee. Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!

[V2]
 Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down, Darkness be over me, my rest a stone. Yet in my dreams I'd be nearer, my God to Thee. Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!

[V3]
 Nearer, my Lord, to thee, Nearer to thee! Who to the cross didst come, Dying for me! Strengthen my willing feet, Hold me in service sweet Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!

[V4]
 Nearer, O Comforter, Nearer to thee! Who with my loving Lord Dwellest with me! Grant me thy fellowship! Help me each day to keep Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee!

[V5]
 But to be nearer still, Bring me, O God, Not by the visioned steeps Angels have trod. Here where thy cross I see, Jesus, I wait for thee, Then evermore to be Nearer to Thee!</lyrics>
