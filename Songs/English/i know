<lyrics>[V1]
 Verse 1
 In the presence of my enemies
 When the storm is crashing down on me
 I will trust in what I cannot see
 I wait for You, I wait for You

[V2]
 Pre-Chorus
 You can part the violent sea
 You can reach the depths of me!

[V3]
 Chorus
 I know, nothing is impossible
 I know, every chain is breakable
 I know, on Christ the solid rock I stand

[V4]
 Verse 2
 I am waiting at the water's edge
 Holding steadfast onto Your promises
 Even though I'm not there yet
 I trust in You, I trust in You

[V5]
 Pre-Chorus
 You can part the violent sea
 You can reach the depths of me!

[V6]
 Chorus
 I know, nothing is impossible
 I know, every chain is breakable
 I know, on Christ the solid rock I stand!
 My fear, is conquered by His perfect love
 My life, is ransomed by His royal blood
 I know, on Christ the solid rock I stand

[V7]
 Bridge
 My hope is built on nothing less
 Than Jesus blood and righteousness
 When darkness seems to hide His face
 I rest in His unchanging grace
 In every high and stormy gale
 My anchor holds within the veil
 On Christ the solid rock I stand
 All other ground is sinking sand!

[V8]
 Chorus
 I know, nothing is impossible
 I know, every chain is breakable
 I know, on Christ the solid rock I stand!
 My fear, is conquered by His perfect love
 My life, is ransomed by His royal blood
 I know, on Christ the solid rock I stand!</lyrics>
