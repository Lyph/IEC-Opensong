 Verse:
.Em        G
 Come on everyone, See what he has done
.Em           G
 He has lifted us, He has overcome
.Em         G        C        Em
 The power of the grave, and the sin that once enslaved
.Em                  Am
 Couldn't hold Him in the ground, couldn't keep him down

[C1]
   Chorus:
.  C             D      G

   Rise Holy Fire, Burn Bright, burn bright
.  C             D     G
   Rise with a shout, cry out for freedom
.  C             Em    G
   Rise church arise, our God's alive

 Verse:
.Em              G

 Conquered Hell and freed us, Forever we are saved

.  Am            Em       D
   He alone can save us, He will not forsake us

   He remains forever,  our Savior
