<lyrics>[V1]
 The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want.
 He makes me lie in pastures green.
 He leads me by the still, still waters,
 His goodness restores my soul.

[V2]
 And I will trust in You alone.
 And I will trust in You alone,
 For Your endless mercy follows me,
 Your goodness will lead me home.

[V3]
 He guides my ways in righteousness,
 And He anoints my head with oil,
 And my cup, it overflows with joy,
 I feast on His pure delights.

[V4]
 And though I walk the darkest path,
 I will not fear the evil one,
 For You are with me, and Your rod and staff
 Are the comfort I need to know.</lyrics>
