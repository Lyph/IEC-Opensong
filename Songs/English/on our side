<title>On Our Side</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Ev'ryone around the world, hear the joyful sound,
 See the heavens open up, hear the music coming down.

[P1]
   Nothing's gonna separate us from the Father's love.
   I can't help but celebrate 'Cause we're not alone.

[C1]
   If God is on our side, who can be against us?
   If God is on our side, we won't be afraid.
   Though the mountains may fall, and the sky will crumble,
   There ain't nothin' gonna stand in our way.

[V2]
 Come one down to the riverside, wash it all away.
 Leave behind your troubled mind for an uncloudy day.</lyrics>
