<lyrics>[V1]
 Come, ye disconsolate, wher'er ye languish; Come to the mercy seat, fervently kneel. Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish; Earth has no sorrow that Heav'n cannot heal.

[V2]
 Joy of the desolate, light of the straying, Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure, Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying, &quot;Earth has no sorrow that Heav'n cannot cure.&quot;

[V3]
 Here see the Bread of Life; see waters flowing Forth from the throne of God, pure from above; Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing Earth has no sorrow but Heav'n can remove.</lyrics>
