<lyrics>[V1]
 Sing, O sing, this blessed morn, Unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is giv'n, God Himself comes down from Heav'n. Sing, O sing, this blessed morn, Jesus Christ today is born.

[V2]
 Jesus Christ, the King of kings, Maker of all worldly things, Now descends from Heav'n to Earth, To re-store us by His birth; Sing, O sing, this blessed morn, Jesus Christ today is born.

[V3]
 God of God, and Light of Light, Comes with mercies infinite; Joining in a wondrous plan Heav'n to earth and God to Man; Sing, O sing, this blessed morn, Jesus Christ today is born.

[V4]
 God with us, Emmanuel, Deigns for ever now to dwell; He on Adam's fallen race Sheds the fullness of His Grace; Sing, O sing, this blessed morn, Jesus Christ today is born.

[V5]
 Truth and Mercy show their face, And with loving kiss embrace; Righteousness looks down from Heav'n, God is pleased and Man forgiv'n; Sing, O sing, this blessed morn, Jesus Christ today is born.

[V6]
 God comes down that man may rise, Lifted far above the skies
 He is Son of Man, that we Sons of God in Him may be;

[V7]
 Human flesh is now become Christ's abode, the Godhead's home;
 Royal Palace, sacred shrine For the Majesty Divine;

[V8]
 Now we rise, from prison free; On we march to victory,
 Joyful banners are unfurled; 'Tis the Birthday of the World;

[V9]
 Now behold the rising Sun Hath His glorious race begun;
 Now the Bridegroom from above Weds the Bride, with heavenly love;

[V10]
 O renew us, Lord, we pray, With Thy Spirit day by day;
 That we ever one may be With the Father, and with Thee;

[V11]
 Sing, O sing this blessed Morn, Jesus Christ to-day is born;
 Glory to the Father give, Praise the Son in whom we live;
 Glory to the Spirit be, Godhead One, and Persons Three.</lyrics>
