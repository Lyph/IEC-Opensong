 I am the Lord your God, I go before you now
 I stand beside you, I'm all around you
 Though you feel I'm far away, I'm closer than your breath
 I am with you, more than you know

[V2]
 I am the Lord your peace, no evil will conquer you
 Steady now your heart and mind, come into My rest
 Oh, let your faith arise, lift up your weary head
 I am with you wherever you go

[V3]
 Come to Me, I'm all you need.
 Come to Me, I'm everything
 Come to Me, I'm all you need.
 Come to Me, I'm your everything

[V4]
 I am your anchor, in the wind and the waves
 I am your steadfast, so don't be afraid
 Though your heart and flesh may fail you, I'm your faithful strength
 I am with you wherever you go

[V5]
 Come to Me, I'm all you need.
 Come to Me, I'm your everything
 Come to Me, I'm all you need.
 Come to Me, I'm your everything

[V6]
 Don't look to the right or to the left but keep your eyes on Me
 You will not be shaken, you will not be moved ooh
 I am the hand to hold, I am the truth, I am the way
 Just come to Me, come to Me, cause I'm all that you need</lyrics>
