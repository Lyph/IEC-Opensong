 I lift my hands to the coming King,
 To the great I AM, to You I sing,
 For You're the One who reigns within my heart.

[V2]
 And I will serve no foreign god,
 Or any other treasure;
 You are my heart's desire,
 Spirit without measure.
 Unto Your name
 I will bring my sacrifice.</lyrics>
