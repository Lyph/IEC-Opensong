.        G                          C
 When I call on your name you answer
.         G                          C
 When I fall you are there by my side
.       G                    C
 You delivered me out of darkness
.           G                       C
 Now i stand in the hope of new life

     I've found a love grater than life itself.

    I've found a hope stronger and nothing compares

    I once was lost, now I'm alive in you.

 You're my God and my firm foundation
 It is you whom I'll trust at all times
 I give glory and praise, adoration
 To me saviour who's seated on high.

     I thank you   I thank you
.  D                     Em
   I once was blind but now i see
