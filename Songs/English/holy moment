.      F#m7
 As we come today
.     E/G#              A
 We remind ourselves of what we do
.           F#m7               E/G#
 That these songs are not just songs
.             D2
 But signs of love for You
.          F#m7 E/G#   A
 This is a holy moment now
.             F#m7   E/G#    A
 Something of heaven touches earth
.          F#m7   E/G#  A
 Voices of angels all resound,
.              Bsus
 We join their song

[C1]
.  F#m7        E/G#
   Come, come, come,
.         A       Bsus
   Let us worship God
.           F#m7       E/G#
   With our hands held high,
.          D2
   And our hearts bowed down.
.          F#m7      E/G#
   We will run, run, run,
.               A        Bsus
   Through Your gates, O God,
.         F#m7          E/G#
   With a shout of love,
.         D2
   With a shout of love.

[V2]
.           F#m7
 Lord, with confidence
.   E/G#             A
 We come before Your throne of grace.
.         F#m7          E/G#
 Not that we deserve to come
.             D2
 But You have paid the way.
.            F#m7 E/G#    A
 You are the holy King of all,
.           F#m7      E/G#    A
 Heaven and earth are in Your hands,
.           F#m7   E/G#      A
 All of the angels sing Your song,
.             Bsus
 We join them now.
