 To Jordan came our Lord the Christ, To do God's pleasure willing, And there was by Saint John baptized, All righteousness fulfilling; There did He consecrate a bath To wash away transgression, And quench the bitterness of death By His own blood and passion; He would a new life give us.

[V2]
 So hear ye all, and well perceive What God doth call baptism, And what a Christian should believe Who error shuns and schism: That we should water use, the Lord Declareth it His pleasure; Not simple water, but the Word And Spirit without measure; He is the true Baptizer.

[V3]
 To show us this, He hath His Word With signs and symbols given; On Jordan's banks was plainly heard The Father's voice from Heaven: &quot;This is My well\beloved Son, In whom My soul delighteth; Hear Him.&quot; Yea, hear Him every one Whom He Himself inviteth, Hear and obey His teaching.

[V4]
 In tender manhood Jesus straight To holy Jordan wendeth; The Holy Ghost from Heaven's gate In dovelike shape descendeth; That thus the truth be not denied, Nor should our faith e'er waver, That the Three Persons all preside, At baptism's holy laver, And dwell with the believer.

[V5]
 Thus Jesus His disciples sent: Go teach ye every nation, That lost in sin they must repent; And flee from condemnation: He that believes and is baptized, Obtains a mighty blessing; A newborn man, no more he dies, Eternal life possessing, A joyful heir of Heaven.

[V6]
 Who in this mercy hath not faith, Nor aught therein discerneth,
 Is yet in sin, condemned to death, And fire that ever burneth;
 His holiness avails him not, Nor aught which he is doing;
 His inborn sin brings all to naught, And maketh sure his ruin;
 Himself he cannot succor.

[V7]
 The eye of sense alone is dim, And nothing sees but water;
 Faith sees Christ Jesus, and in Him The Lamb ordained for slaughter;
 She sees the cleansing fountain red With the dear blood of Jesus,
 Which from the sins inherited From fallen Adam frees us,
 And from our own misdoings.</lyrics>
