 Jesus, You're the sweetest name of all
 Jesus, You always hear me when I call
 Oh, Jesus, You pick me up each time I fall
 You're the sweetest, sweetest name of all

[V2]
 Jesus, how I love to praise Your name
 Jesus, you're still the first, the last, the same
 Oh, Jesus, You died and took away my shame
 You're the sweetest, sweetest name of all

[V3]
 Jesus, You're the soon and coming King
 Jesus, we need the love that You can bring
 Oh, Jesus, we lift our voices up and sing
 You're the sweetest, sweetest name of all</lyrics>
