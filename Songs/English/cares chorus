<lyrics>[V1]
.  D           A          G  D
 I cast all my cares upon You,
.  G             D       Em           A
 I lay all of my burdens down at Your feet.
.        D            A    G       Gm
 And any time I don't know what to do,
.       D           A          G  D
 I will cast all my cares upon You.

 I cast all my cares upon You,

 I lay all of my burdens down at Your feet.
