 Verse 1:
.A/C#            D            Esus
 What fortunes lies beyond the stars
.                F#m               A/C#
 Those dazzling heights too vast to climb
.          D            Esus
 I got so high to fall so far

 But I found heaven as love swept low

   I found my life when I laid it down
.        D          Esus
   Upward falling, spirit soaring
.          E
   I touch the sky when my knees hit the ground

 This gift of freedom gold can&amp;amp;#039;t buy

 You traded heaven to have me again
