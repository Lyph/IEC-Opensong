.  A          Bm         D
   Make me... Take me... Break me.
.       E
   I am pierced.
.  A          Bm         D
   Make me... Take me... Break me.
.       D
   I am pierced.

[V1]
.            A           Bm
 Though I am wounded and unworthy,
.            D            E
 Though I am selfish and untrue,
.        A                Bm
 You are holy, You're the healer.
.    D                      E
 You forgave me and made me new,
.            A
 You made me new.

[B1]
.  E       Bm7             E
   Oh this love how can it be
.          Bm7               E
   That my God would die for me?
.         Bm7                  E
   For my sins, His wounds did bleed.
.         Bm7      E           A
   Jesus, you were pierced for me.

[B2]
.  A
   Make me (make me, Lord Jesus)
.  Bm
   Take me (take me, Lord Jesus)
.  D
   Break me (break me, Lord Jesus)
.       E
   I am pierced (oh, oh, oh)
