<lyrics>[C1]
   Not by might, not by power
   By your spirit God send your spirit God
   Not by might, not by power
   By your spirit God send your spirit God

[V1]
 You are the fire we are the temple
 Your are the voice we are your song
 You are our God we are your people
 You are the light we stand in awe

[C2]
   PreWe stand in awe of you
   We stand in awe of you

[V2]
 You called us out Out of the darkness
 Into your love into your light
 Grace upon grace beauty for ashes
 You come to us we come alive

[B1]
   Breathe come and breathe on us
   Spirit breathe come and breathe on us</lyrics>
