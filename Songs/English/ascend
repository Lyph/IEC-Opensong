<lyrics>[V1]
 Come let us see our Lord and King
 He's reigning in glory
 Lift up your eyes all earth and sky
 His Kingdom is coming

[V2]
 From glory to glory
 We will arise

[V3]
 We will ascend the hill of the Lord
 And we will declare His holy word
 With clean hands and pure hearts
 With clean hands and pure hearts
 We will see God

[V4]
 We fix our eyes, we give our lives
 Our hope is in heaven
 So let us run, we have overcome
 Now and forever

[V5]
 And when we see Him we'll be like Him
 And face to face we'll know what love is</lyrics>
