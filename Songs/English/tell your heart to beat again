 Verse: 1
.      Dm
 You're shattered
.   Bb          F   C
 Like you've never been before
.              Dm
 The life you knew
.Bb               F               C
   In a thousand pieces on the floor
.                Dm                   Bb
 And words fall short in times like these
.                   F                  C
 When this world drives you to your knees
.                 Bb
 You think you're never gonna get back
.                        C
 To the you that used to be

[C1]
   Chorus:
.  F
   Tell your heart to beat again
.  C
   Close your eyes and breathe it in
.  Dm
   Let the shadows fall away
.  Bb
   Step into the light of grace
.  C
   Yesterday's a closing door
.  Dm
   You don't live there anymore
.  Bb       F
   Say goodbye to where you've been
.  Bb             F
   And tell your heart to beat again

 Verse: 2
.  Dm    Bb
 Beginning
.               F              C
 Just let that word wash over you
.       Dm      Bb
 It's alright now
.                 F                       C

 Leave the darkness, feel the sun

 Cause your story's far from over

 And your journey's just begun

   And every scar
.        Bb
   Be a picture that reminds you
.                             F
   Who has carried you this far
.                   C                      Dm
   'Cause love sees farther than you ever could
.           Bb
   In this moment heaven's working

 Everything for your good
