 Peace, bring it all to peace
 The storms surrounding me
 Let it break at Your name

[V2]
 Still, call the sea to still
 The rage in me to still
 Every wave at Your name

[C1]
   Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
   Jesus, Jesus, You silence fear
   Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
   Jesus, Jesus

[V3]
 Breathe, call these bones to live
 Call these lungs to sing
 Once again, I will praise

[B1]
   Your name is a light that the shadows can't deny
   Your name cannot be overcome
   Your name is alive forever lifted high
   Your name cannot be overcome</lyrics>
