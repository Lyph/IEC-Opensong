<lyrics>[V1]
 Wherever I've gone on the path of life
 No matter how much fear I've met
 I always felt beside me
 The gracious hand of my Savior
 And even if I got tired along the way
 You always gently lifted me up
 And gave me hope again

[C1]
   You are always with me, You are always with me,
   I firmly know that always
   Your hand is with me You are with me.
   Let it be dark around me
   But in my soul it is light because I know, I believe
   that you are always with me.

[V2]
 If the darkness gathered round me
 Or my friends walked away
 I was not afraid, for with You
 I walked through this stormy life
 And whatever happens in my life
 I'm ready to sing, not cry
 I'm already lifted up from this thought:
 You can warm my heart.</lyrics>
