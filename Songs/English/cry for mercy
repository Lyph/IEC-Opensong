.E                          A
 Oh Lord, Your mercy covers me.
.E                           A
 Oh God, Your peace consumes my heart.
.        C#m                  A
 I'm overwhelmed by Your love,
.            C#m               A
 And I'm overcome with my need.
.       E               B                 A   BA
 I'm so thirsty, I'm so hungry, Lord, for You.

[C1]
.      E             A        C#m           A
   And I cry out for mercy and I fall on my knee.
.    E              B            A
   I lay my cares before You, my King.
.    E            A          C#m        A
   I give up my own life and offer You everything.
.  E             B            A
   I'm falling before You, my King.</lyrics>
