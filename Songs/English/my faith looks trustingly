<lyrics>[V1]
 My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary, Savior divine! Now hear me while I pray, take all my guilt away, O let me from this day be wholly Thine!

[V2]
 May Thy rich grace impart Strength to my fainting heart, my zeal inspire! As Thou hast died for me, O may my love to Thee, Pure warm, and changeless be, a living fire!

[V3]
 While life's dark maze I tread, And griefs around me spread, be Thou my Guide; Bid darkness turn to day, wipe sorrow's tears away, Nor let me ever stray from Thee aside.

[V4]
 When ends life's transient dream, When death's cold sullen stream over me roll; Blest Savior, then in love, fear and distrust remove; O bear me safe above, a ransomed soul!</lyrics>
