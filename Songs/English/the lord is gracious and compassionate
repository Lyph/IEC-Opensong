<lyrics>[V1]
 The Lord is gracious and compassionate,
 Slow to anger and rich in love.
 The Lord is gracious and compassionate,
 Slow to anger and rich in love.
 The Lord is good to all.
 He has compassion for all that He has made,

[V2]
 As far as the east is from the west,
 That's how far He has removed our
 transgressions from us. (Repeat)

[V3]
 Praise the Lord, oh my soul, praise the Lord.
 Praise the Lord, oh my soul, praise the Lord.</lyrics>
