<lyrics>[V1]
 Hear the holy roar of God resound.
 Watch the waters part before us now.
 Come and see what He has done for us.
 Tell the world of His great love.

[P1]
   Our God is a God who saves.
   Our God is a God who saves.

[C1]
   Let God arise.
   Let God arise.
   Our God reigns now and forever,
   He reigns now and forever.

[V2]
 His enemies will run for sure.
 The Church will stand she will endure.
 He holds the keys of life, our Lord.
 Death has no sting, no final word.</lyrics>
