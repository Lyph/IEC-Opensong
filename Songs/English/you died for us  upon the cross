  <lyrics>[V1]
 You died for us - upon the cross
 And You took all our sins away.
 With Your blood - You washed us clean.
 Today we stand before You, Lord,
 In Your righteousness.

[C1]
   // We are free, thanks be to God,
   Through Jesus Christ!
   We are free and we are rich,
   Lord, by Your grace.
   We are free, thanks be to God!
   We love You, Jesus,
   Lamb of God, King of Kings,
   Our Prince of Peace.  //
   Thank You, Lord!</lyrics>
