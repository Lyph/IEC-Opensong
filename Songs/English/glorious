 We lift our hands in praise to You.
 We lift our hearts in worship to You, Lord.
 We lift our voice to You and sing.
 Our greatest love will ever be You, Lord,
 You, Lord!

[C1]
   Glorious, over us,
   You shall reign glorious.

[V2]
 There is a King that we adore.
 With humble hearts we bow before You, Lord.
 There is a place we long to be.
 Yes, face to face, we long to see You, Lord,
 You, Lord!

[B1]
   Majesty and power
   Are Yours alone forever! (2X)</lyrics>
