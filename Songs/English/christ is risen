<lyrics>[V1]
.    Emaj9
 Let no one caught in sin remain
.  Amaj9
 Inside the lie of inward shame,
.   Emaj9/G#
 But fix our eyes upon the cross
.   Amaj9            C#m7        B(4)
 And run to Him who showed great love
.    Emaj9/G# Amaj9 B(4)
 And bled     for   us.
.              Emaj9/G# Amaj9 B(4)
 Freely You've bled     for   us.

[C1]
.              E2
   Christ is risen from the dead,
   Trampling over death by death.
.        Amaj9
   Come awake! Come awake!
.           C#m7             B(4)
   Come and rise up from the grave!
.              E2
   Christ is risen from the dead,
.         E2/G#
   We are one with Him again.
.        Amaj9
   Come awake! Come awake!
.           C#m7             B(4)
   Come and rise up from the grave!

[V2]
.  Emaj9
 Beneath the weight of all our sin,
.    Amaj9
 You bowed to none but heaven's will.
.   Emaj9/G#
 No scheme of hell, no scoffer's crown,
.   Amaj9            C#m7     B(4)
 No burden great can hold You down.
.   Emaj9/G#  Amaj9 B(4)
 In strength, You   reign.
.                 Emaj9/G# Amaj9 B#(4)
 Forever let Your church   pro___claim:

[B1]
.  E2/G# A2    C#m7          Bsus
   O,    death where is your sting?
.  E2/G# A2   C#m7          Bsus
   O,    hell where is your victory?
.  E2/G# A2          C#m7         Bsus
   O,    church come stand in the light!
.       E2/G#   A2         C#m7      Bsus
   The glory of God has defeated the night!
.          E2/G# A2    C#m7          Bsus
   Singing O,    death where is your sting?
.  E2/G# A2   C#m7          Bsus
   O,    hell where is your victory?
.  E2/G# A2          C#m7         Bsus
   O,    church come stand in the light!
.      E2/G#      A2          C#m7        Bsus
   Our God is not dead! He's alive! He's alive!</lyrics>
