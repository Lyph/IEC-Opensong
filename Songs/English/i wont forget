<title>I Won't Forget</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 [Verse 1]
 I won't forget the price You paid
 Though death was mine, You took my place
 I won't forget the sacrifice
 For to this love I owe my life

[V2]
 [Chorus]
 Jesus, oh the wonder of Your Name
 Jesus, I'm forever changed

[V3]
 [Verse 2]
 You searched my heart and know my ways
 You've held me in Your hands of grace
 Now I have found my peace with God
 A refuge in my Saviour's love

[V4]
 [Chorus]
 Jesus, oh the wonder of Your Name
 Jesus, I'm forever changed
 Jesus, oh the wonder of Your Name
 Jesus, I'm forever changed

[V5]
 [Bridge]
 You came in the night and tore down the walls
 That held my broken heart
 When all I could see lay ruined scarred
 Your light shattered the dark
 You came in the night and tore down the walls
 That held my broken heart
 When all I could see lay ruined and scarred
 Your light shattered the dark

[V6]
 [Chorus]
 Jesus, oh the wonder of Your Name
 Jesus, I'm forever changed</lyrics>
