<lyrics>[V1]
.            G
 Why are you striving these days?
.            Em
 Why are you trying to earn grace?
.            D                           C
 Why are you crying? Let me lift up your face.
.                G
 Just don't turn away.

[V2]
.            G
 Why are you looking for love?
.                  Em
 Why are you still searching as if I'm not enough?
.                  D
 To where will you go, child?
.                       C
 Tell me where will you run?
.                   G
 To where will you run?

[C1]
.                 Em                        C
   'Cause I'll be by your side wherever you fall,
.         G                  D
   In the dead of night, whenever you call,
.      Em                       C                      G
   And please don't fight these hands that are holding you.
.        D                    G
   Yeah, my hands are holding you.

[V3]
.              G
 Look at these hands and My side.
.                   Em
 They swallowed the grave on that night
.                         D                        C
 When I drank the world's sin so I could carry you in
.             G                      D
 And give you life. I wanna give you life.

[B1]
.        D         Em
   Cause I, I love you.
.         C      D
   I want you to know.
.       D         Em
   That I, I love you.
.       C             D
   I'll never let you go.</lyrics>
