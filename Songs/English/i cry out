.G
 I cry out
.C        Em            C
 For Your hand of mercy to heal me
.G
 I am weak
.C           Em           C
 I need Your love to free me
.G          C
 Oh Lord my rock
.G              C
 My strength in weakness
.Em          Bm    C
 Come rescue me oh Lord.

[V2]
.           D
 You are my hope
.     G       C     D     G
 Your promise never fails me
.       D            G      C   D   G
 And my desire is to follow You forever.
