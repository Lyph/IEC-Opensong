.Gm          D#
 Nothing can separate
.A#          F
 Even if I ran away
.Gm               D#  A#F
 Your love never fails
.Gm        D#
 I know I still make mistakes
.     A#                           F
 But You have new mercies for me everyday

 Your love never fails

   You stay the same through the ages
.  Cm               D#
   Your love never changes
.                A#
   There may be pain in the night

 Verse: 2
.Gm                          D#
 The wind is strong and the water's deep
.   A#                            F
 But I'm not alone here in these open seas
.      Gm               D#  A#F
 Cause Your love never fails
.Gm          D#
 The chasm is far too wide
.A#                            F
 I never thought I'd reach the other side
.     Gm              D#  A#F
 But Your love never fails
