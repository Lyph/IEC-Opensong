<lyrics>[V1]
 Baptized into Thy Name most holy, O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I claim a place, though weak and lowly, Among Thy seed, Thy chosen host. Buried with Christ and dead to sin, Thy Spirit now shall live within.

[V2]
 My loving Father, here doth take me To be henceforth His child and heir; My faithful Savior, now doth make me The fruit of all His sorrows share; My Comforter will comfort me When darkest clouds around I see.

[V3]
 And I have vowed to fear and love Thee And to obey Thee, Lord, alone; I felt Thy Holy Spirit move me, I dared to pledge myself Thine own, Renouncing sin to keep the faith And war with evil unto death.

[V4]
 My faithful God, Thou failest never, Thy cov'nant surely will abide; Oh, cast me not away forever Should I transgress it on my side! But if I fall hide not Thy face, Restore Thy child, Lord, by Thy Grace.

[V5]
 Yes, all I am and love most dearly, To Thee I offer now the whole; O let me make my vows sincerely, Take full possession of my soul! Let naught within me, naught I own, Serve any will save Thine alone.

[V6]
 Hence, Prince of darkness, hence forever,
 For I belong now to my God!
 'Tis true, I sinned; but my dear Savior Hath
 cleansed me with His holy blood.
 Away, vain world, sin, leave me now,
 I turn from you; God hears my vow.

[V7]
 And never let my purpose falter,
 O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
 But keep me faithful to Thine altar,
 Till Thou shalt call me from my post;
 So unto Thee I live and die,
 And praise Thee evermore on high.</lyrics>
