<lyrics>[V1]
 Be still my heart and know
 You are God alone
 Stop thinking so much
 and just let go

[V2]
 Be still my soul and rest
 Humbly I confess,
 in my weakness your strength is perfect

[V3]
 For You alone are God, there will be no other
 And You have won my heart more than any other
 So I will give it all 'cause you gave it all for me

[V4]
 Be still my heart and know
 You are God alone
 Stop thinking stop thinking so much
 and just let go

[V5]
 Be still my soul and rest
 Humbly I confess,
 in my weakness your strength is perfect

[V6]
 For You alone are God, there will be no other
 And You have won my heart more than any other
 So I will give it all 'cause you gave it all for me x2

[V7]
 Gave it all for me yeah

[V8]
 Bless the Lord oh my soul cries out
 All that is within me prays x4</lyrics>
