 Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son;
 Endless is the victory, Thou o'er death hast won;
 Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,
 Kept the folded grave clothes where Thy body lay.

[V2]
 Thine be the glory, risen conqu'ring Son,
 Endless is the vict'ry, Thou o'er death hast won.

[V3]
 Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb;
 Lovingly He greets us, scatters fear and gloom;
 Let the church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing;
 For her Lord now liveth, death hath lost its sting.

[V4]
 No more we doubt Thee, glorious Prince of life;
 Life is naught without Thee; aid us in our strife;
 Make us more than conqu'rors, through Thy
 deathless love:
 Bring us safe through Jordan to Thy home above.</lyrics>
