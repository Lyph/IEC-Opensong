<lyrics>[V1]
.          Em9                C
 There's a peace I've come to know,
.          G                   D5
 though my heart and flesh may fail.
.           Em9           C
 There's an anchor for my soul;
.      G           D
 I can say, &quot;It is well.&quot;

[P1]
.  G             D/F#
   Jesus has overcome,
.          Em7          C2
   and the grave is overwhelmed.
.      G/B        Dsus
   The victory is won;
.  D .   Em9            C2
   He is risen from the dead!

[C1]
.             G2           Dadd4
   And I will rise when He calls my name.
.  Em9             C2
   No more sorrow, no more pain.
.         G2      Dadd4
   I will rise on eagle's wings,
.     Em9              C2              G2
   before my God, fall on my knees and rise.
.         G/D  D
   I will rise.

[V2]
.          Em9                C2
 There's a day that's drawing near
.          Gmaj7              Dadd4
 when this darkness breaks to light,
.        Em9          C2
 And the shadows disappear,
.       Gmaj7             Dadd4
 and my faith shall be my eyes.

[B1]
.                 C2       G    D             C2     G      D
   And I hear the voice of many angels sing, &quot;Worthy is the Lamb!&quot;
.                 C2      G    D               C2     G      D
   And I hear the cry of ev'ry longing heart, &quot;Worthy is the Lamb!&quot;
.                 C2       G    D             C2     G      D
   And I hear the voice of many angels sing, &quot;Worthy is the Lamb!&quot;
.                 C2      G    D       Em7     C2     G      D
   And I hear the cry of ev'ry longing heart, &quot;Worthy is the Lamb!&quot;
.   C2     G      D     G2Dadd4Em7C2
   &quot;Worthy is the Lamb!&quot;

[B2]
.         G/D  C2/E
   I will rise.
.         G/D  Dadd4G
   I will rise.</lyrics>
