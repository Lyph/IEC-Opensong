 As a parched land thirsts for water
 So I yearn and long for you
 As a wilting leaf thirsts for rain
 So I watch for you
 Messiah, Messiah

[V2]
 In desolate deserts
 I search for an oasis
 I am weary. I long to rest
 In the shadow of your wings
 Messiah, Messiah

[V3]
 Amidst the angry waters
 I search for safe harbor
 I am weary. I long to rest
 In the shelter of your presence
 Messiah, Messiah</lyrics>
