<lyrics>[V1]
 Your voice is the voice that
 Commanded the universe to be
 Your voice is the voice that
 Is speaking words of love to me
 How can it be?

[V2]
 Awesome God Holy God
 I worship You in wonder
 Awesome God Holy God
 As You draw near I'm humbled
 By Your majesty and the mystery
 Of Your great love for me

[V3]
 Your arms are the arms that
 Hung shining stars in deepest space
 Your arms are the arms that
 Surround me in a warm embrace
 Amazing grace</lyrics>
