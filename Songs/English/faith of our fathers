<lyrics>[V1]
 Faith of our fathers, living still, In spite of dungeon, fire and sword; O how our hearts beat high with joy Whene'er we hear that glorious Word! Faith of our fathers, holy faith! We will be true to thee till death.

[V2]
 Faith of our fathers, we will strive To win all nations unto Thee; And through the truth that comes from God, We all shall then be truly free. Faith of our fathers, holy faith! We will be true to thee till death.

[V3]
 Faith of our fathers, we will love Both friend and foe in all our strife; And preach Thee, too, as love knows how By kindly words and virtuous life. Faith of our fathers, holy faith! We will be true to thee till death.</lyrics>
