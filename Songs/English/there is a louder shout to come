.E                                F#m7
 There is a louder shout to come, there is a sweeter song to hear;
.C#m             B        A      F#m7           E/G#     B
 All the nations with one voice, all the people with one fear.
.E                               F#m7
 Bowing down before Your throne, every tribe and tongue will be;
.C#m             B        A      F#m7           E/G#     B
 All the nations with one voice, all the people with one King.
.    F#m7              E/G#           A
 And what a song we'll sing upon that day.

[C1]
.  E        F#m7       B        E        A          B
   O what a song we'll sing and O what a tune we'll bear;
.  F#m7           G#m7          A
   You deserve an anthem of the highest praise.
.  E        F#m7     B        E        A           B
   O what a joy will rise and O what a sound we'll make;
.  F#m7           G#m7          A             (E)
   You deserve an anthem of the highest praise.

[V2]
 Now we see a part of this, one day we shall see in full;
 All the nations with one voice, all the people with one love.
 No one else will share Your praise, nothing else can take Your place;
 All the nations with one voice, all the people with one Lord.
 And what a song we'll sing upon that day.

[V3]
 Even now upon the earth, there's a glimpse of all to come;
 Many people with one voice, harmony of many tongues.
 We will all confess Your name, You will be our only praise;
 All the nations with one voice, all the people with one God.
 And what a song we'll sing upon that day.</lyrics>
