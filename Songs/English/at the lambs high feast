<lyrics>[V1]
 At the Lamb's high feast we sing, Praise to our victorious King, Who has washed us in the tide Flowing from his pierc√®d side; Alleluia!

[V2]
 Praise we Him, whose love divine Gives His sacred blood for wine, Gives His body for the feast, Christ the Victim, Christ the Priest. Alleluia!

[V3]
 Where the Paschal blood is poured, Death's dark angel sheathes his sword; Israel's hosts triumphant go Through the wave that drowns the foe. Alleluia!

[V4]
 Praise we Christ, whose blood was shed, Paschal Victim, Paschal Bread; With sincerity and love Eat we Manna from above. Alleluia!

[V5]
 Mighty Victim from the sky, Hell's fierce pow'rs beneath Thee lie; Thou hast conquered in the fight, Thou hast brought us life and light; Alleluia!

[V6]
 Now no more can death appall,
 Now no more the grave enthrall;
 Thou hast opened Paradise,
 And in Thee Thy saints shall rise.

[V7]
 Paschal triumph, Easter joy,
 This alone can sin destroy;
 From sin's death do Thou set free
 Souls reborn, O Lord, in Thee.

[V8]
 Hymns of glory and of praise,
 Father, to Thee we raise;
 Risen Lord, all praise to Thee,
 Ever with the Spirit be.</lyrics>
