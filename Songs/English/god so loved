 VERSE 1:
 I shall hold
 To the cross
 I shall hold
 To God alone
 For His love
 Has salvaged me
 For His love
 Has set me free

[C1]
   CHORUS:
   For God so loved the world
   That He gave His only Son
   Whosoever believes
   Will not perish
   They shall have eternal life

[V2]
 VERSE 2:
 I shall wait
 Upon the Lord
 I shall wait
 Upon His Word
 By His grace
 I am released
 By His grace
 I am redeemed

[B1]
   BRIDGE:
   By His precious blood
   I have been set free
   For the glory of Jesus' Name
   I surrender all
   Now to Christ alone
   In Jesus I am saved

[V3]
