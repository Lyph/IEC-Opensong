<lyrics>[V1]
.     Cmaj7
 Like the water's roar
.   G/B
 is Your voice, O Lord.
.      Am7
 There is none before
.    Dsus
 and none beside.
.    Cmaj7
 You are set apart;
.     G/B
 You alone are God.
.            Am7
 Your glory reaches far,
.     Cmaj7  Dsus
 from sky to sky.

[C1]
.  G     Am7   G/B        C2
   Holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
.  G/B          C2         Dsus
   Early in the morning we will sing.
.  G     Am7      G/B         C2
   Holy, holy, we bow down before Thee.
.  Em7               G/B               Cmaj7
   All Your children love to sing Your name,
.        Dsus   Em11D6/9GAm9
   God Almighty.

[V2]
 You're the breath of life;
 You're the God on high.
 Your song shall rise
 and never pass away.
 O Your Majesty
 evermore shall be.
 The earth, the skies, the sea
 shall bring You praise.

[B1]
.      G/B       C
   And I hide my eyes
.          Em          G
   with my face to the ground
.            C     G       D    G
   In the presence of Your Majesty.
.      G/B       C
   And I clap my hands
.        Em     G
   and I lay my crowns
.            C     G       D    G
   In the presence of Your Majesty.</lyrics>
