<lyrics>[V1]
 Holy God, generations know
 Your promises, Your covenant of love.
 Lord of all, every promise made
 You remain faithful to fulfil.
 For Your ways are holy,
 And Your name is worthy,
 All honour and glory belongs to You.

[V2]
 For You are faithful, mighty, glorious,
 Awesome and victorious,
 Beautiful and wonderful, O Lord.
 Now our hearts are resolute,
 Our confidence is all in You,
 Everything is possible, O Lord, my God.

[V3]
 When trouble's hard, when life overwhelms,
 You are Lord, You are in control.
 I trust in You for in my darkest day,
 You remain worthy of my praise.
 For Your ways are higher,
 And Your arm is stronger,
 And Your rest is sweeter than any other.</lyrics>
