<lyrics>[V1]
 The precious blood of Jesus Christ redeems,
 Forgiven i'm alive, restored set free.
 Your majesty resides inside of me,
 Forever i believe. forever i believe.

[V2]
 Arrested by your truth and righteousness
 Your grace has overwhelmed my brokenness
 Convicted by your spirit, led by your word
 Your love will never fail, Your love will never fail

[C1]
   'Cause i know you gave, the world your only son for us to
   Know your name, to live within the saviours love
   And he took my place, knowing he'd be crucified
   And you loved.. you loved, a people undeserving!</lyrics>
