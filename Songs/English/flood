<lyrics>[V1]
.F     Eb             Cm
 Rain, rain on my face.
.F              Cm
 Hasn't stopped raining for days.
.Fm Eb              Cm
 My world is a flood.
.F                 Eb Cm
 Slowly I've becomeone with the mud.

[C1]
.         F       Eb            Cm
   But if I can't swim after forty days,
.            F           Eb      Cm
   And my mind is crushed by the crashing waves,
.            F      Eb         Cm
   Lift me up so high that I cannot fall.
.            F     Eb
   Lift me, oh woh!

[B1]
.  Cm         F Dbmaj7   Eb
   Lift me up when I'm falling.
.  Gm7        F .      Dbmaj7        Eb
   Lift me up when I'm weak and I'm dying.
.  Bb2        F . Dbmaj7          Eb
   Lift me up;I   need you to hold me.
.  Gm7        F . Dbmaj7           Eb         F
   Lift me up and keep me from drowning again.

[V2]
.F   Eb             Cm
 Downpour on my soul.
.    F            Eb         Cm
 Splashing in the ocean, I'm losing control.
.F    Eb            Cm
 Dark sky all around.
.F     Eb           Cm
 Can't feel my feet touching the ground.

[B2]
   Calm the storms that drench my eyes.
   Dry the streams still flowing.
   Cast down all the waves of sin
   And guilt that overthrow me.</lyrics>
