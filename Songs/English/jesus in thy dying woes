 Jesus, in Thy dying woes, Even while Thy lifeblood flows, Craving pardon for Thy foes; Hear us, holy Jesus.

[V2]
 Savior, for our pardon sue, When our sins Thy pangs renew, For we know not what we do: Hear us, holy Jesus.

[V3]
 O may we, who mercy need, Be like Thee in heart and deed, When with wrong our spirits bleed: Hear us, holy Jesus.

 Jesus, pitying the sighs
 Of the thief, who near Thee dies,
 Promising him paradise;

 May we, in our guilt and shame,
 Still Thy love and mercy claim,
 Calling humbly on Thy Name:
 Hear us, holy Jesus.

 O remember us who pine,
 Looking from our cross to Thine;
 Cheer our souls with hope divine:
 Hear us, holy Jesus.Part 3: &quot;Woman, behold thy son!

 Jesus, loving to the end
 Her whose heart Thy sorrows rend,

 May we in Thy sorrows share,
 And for Thee all peril dare,
 And enjoy Thy tender care:
 Hear us, holy Jesus.

 May we all Thy loved ones be,
 All one holy family,
 Loving for the love of Thee,
 Hear us, holy Jesus.Part 4: &quot;My God, my God, why hast

 Jesus, whelmed in fears unknown,
 With our evil left alone,
 While no light from Heav'n is shown:

 When we vainly seem to pray,
 and our hope seems far away,
 In the darkness be our stay.
 Hear us, holy Jesus.

 Though no light our spirits cheer,
 Tell our faith that God is near:
 Hear us, holy Jesus.Part 5: &quot;I thirst.&quot; (Jn 19:28)

[V14]
 Jesus, in Thy thirst and pain,
 While Thy wounds Thy lifeblood drain,
 Thirsting more our love to gain:
 Hear us, holy Jesus.

[V15]
 Thirst for us in mercy still;
 All Thy holy work fulfill;
 Satisfy Thy loving will:
 Hear us, holy Jesus.

[V16]
 May we thirst Thy love to know;
 Lead us in our sin and woe
 Where the healing waters flow:
 Hear us, holy Jesus.Part 6: &quot;It is finished&quot; (Jn 19:30)

[V17]
 Jesus, all our ransom paid,
 All Thy Father's will obeyed,
 All Thy suff'rings perfect made:

[V18]
 Save us in our soul's distress,
 Be our help to cheer and bless,
 While we grow in holiness:
 Hear us, holy Jesus.

[V19]
 Brighten all our heavenward way,
 With an ever holier ray,
 Till we pass to perfect day:
 Hear us, holy Jesus.Part 7: &quot;Father, into thy hands
 I commend my spirit&quot; (Lk 23:46)

[V20]
 Jesus, all Thy labor vast,
 All Thy woe and conflict past,
 Yielding up Thy soul at last:
 Hear us, holy Jesus.

[V21]
 When the death shades round us lower,
 Guard us from the temper's power,
 Keep us in that trial hour:
 Hear us, holy Jesus.

[V22]
 May Thy life and death supply
 Grace to live and grace to die,
 Grace to reach the home on high:
 Hear us, holy Jesus.</lyrics>
