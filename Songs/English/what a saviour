 VERSE 1:
.      F    C        F6 C
 What a Saviour, my Redeemer
.         F  C            G
 Friend of sinners, one like me
.       F   C            F6 C
 Oh what kindness suffered violence
.         Am   C       G      F
 Healed my blindness and set me free

[C1]
   CHORUS:
.         Am        F               C G
   Oh what grace I've found in You my Jesus
.         Am         F             C  G
   That my soul should entertain Your greatness
.                 F        C             Am  G
   And should this life hold nothing but my Saviour
.         F     C   Am  G
   I will praise You always

 VERSE 2:
 Heaven's glory clothed in mercy
 Knew my story yet took my end
 Oh what freedom, hope like heaven
 Now forgiven I'll rise again

   BRIDGE:
.  F
   Should this life I live
.  G           Em7     Am
   Hold nothing but the cross
.                    C
   Where Jesus took my shame
.  F
   Then with arms stretched wide
.  G              Em7
   And my head held high
.                          C
   My every breath will sing again</lyrics>
