<lyrics>[V1]
 When hard pressed I cried out to the Lord
 And he brought me into a spacious place.
 I will praise you for you answered me
 And have become my salvation.

[V2]
 I will not die but I will live,
 And I will proclaim what the Lord has done.

[V3]
 The stone the builders rejected
 Has become the chief cornerstone.

[V4]
 You are my God and I will praise you.
 My God, I will exalt you</lyrics>
