 It's 2 o'clock, your eyes are shut,
 your phone alarm is going off
 The sun is up, you're still in bed,
 another day gone again

[V2]
 This isn't what you wanted was it
 I know you've got
 a pulse let's get it started

[C1]
   You've got one shot,
   all you got take it now
   You gotta get up, get up,
   get up oh-wo-oh-wo-oh
   One life, live it right,
   keep on moving forward
   You've got one shot
   everybody it's your time
   I wanna see you on the other side
   You've got one shot,
   all you got, live out loud
   Come on wake up, wake up,
   wake up before it's over

[V3]
 You got a truck, take a drive
 go somewhere to feel alive
 You got a dream, say a prayer,
 a little faith will get ya there

[V4]
 This is what
 you wanted promise
 Never go back to
 the way you started

[B1]
   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
   oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</lyrics>
