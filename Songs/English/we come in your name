<lyrics>[V1]
 We come in Your name
 For all things You have made
 And by Your Word all things You sustain
 The Lamb that was slain
 For our sins lives to reign
 The Lord of all, Name above all names!

[V2]
 We have been saved by faith
 Into Your glorious Name
 And this a gift of grace, freely given us
 Now all our sins are gone
 Defeated at the cross
 And we now live in You
 Raised with You by the power of God!

[V3]
 You have been lifted to the highest place
 And You now live and rule forever!
 We come to bring to You the highest praise
 For You are King of kings forever:
 Son of God, Jesus!

[V4]
 Holy is the Lamb
 Worthy of glory, worthy of honour
 High and lifted up and seated in majesty
 Your throne will last forever
 Your throne will last forever
 Your throne will last forevermore</lyrics>
