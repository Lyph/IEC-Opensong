.  F#m            D          A    E
 I lay all that I am at Your feet.

 I give You all of my life; I give You all of me.

.                   F#m A
 Because of who You are,
.          E                  D
 Because of who You said I'll be,
.                      F#m  A
 Because of all You've done,
.        E                   D
 For the work You've done in me.

.            F#m                E                D
   I give my life for what it's worth; I give my soul.

   I'm giving up every part

   that I may hold.
.                A/C#                 D
   I offer up to You this humble sacrifice.
.              E               D
   I'm letting go; I'm letting go.
.                A/C#                 D
   I offer up to You this humble sacrifice.
.              E               F#m ED
   I'm letting go; I'm letting go.</lyrics>
