<lyrics>[V1]
 If my heart is overwhelmed and I cannot hear Your voice
 I'll hold on to what is true though I cannot see
 If the storms of life they come and the road ahead gets steep
 I will lift these hands in faith, I will believe

[V2]
 I remind myself of all that You've done
 And the life I have because of Your Son

[V3]
 Love came down and rescued me
 Love came down and set me free
 Now I am Yours, I am forever Yours

[V4]
 Mountain high or valley low

[V5]
 I sing out, remind my soul
 I am Yours, I am forever Yours

[V6]
 When my heart is filled with hope, when every promise comes my way
 When I feel Your hands of grace rest upon me
 Staying desperate for You God, staying humbled at Your feet
 I will lift these and praise, I will believe

[V7]
 I am Yours, I am Yours
 All my days I am Yours</lyrics>
