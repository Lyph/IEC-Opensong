.D                             Em7
 Over the mountains and the sea
.                                G
 Your river runs with love for me
.                      Asus
 And I will open up my heart
.                              D
 And let the healer set me free
.                            Em7
 I'm happy to be in the truth
.                              G
 And I will daily lift my hands
.                          A                      D
 For I will always sing of when Your love came down

[C1]
.  D                    Em7         G
   I could sing of Your love forever
.                       A           D
   I could sing of Your love forever
.                       Em7         G
   I could sing of Your love forever
.                       A           Em7 (D)
   I could sing of Your love forever

[V2]
.Em7            D
 Oh I feel like dancing
.                   A   Asus Em7
 It's foolishness I know
.                       D
 But when the world has seen the light
.                                    Asus       D
 They will dance with joy like we're dancing now</lyrics>
