.D             G       Asus D
 To be in Your Presence
.               G   Asus7    D
 To sit at Your feet
.                G                  Asus7   D
 Where Your love surrounds me
.             G         Asus7    D
 And makes me complete

[C1]
.             Em       Asus7
   This is my desire O Lord
.             D     D/C
   This is my desire
.             Em       Asus7
   This is my desire O Lord
.             D
   This is my desire

[V2]
 To rest in Your presence
 Not rushing away
 To cherish each Moment
 Here I would stay</lyrics>
