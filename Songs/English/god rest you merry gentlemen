<lyrics>[V1]
 God rest you merry, gentlemen,
 Let nothing you dismay,
 For Jesus Christ our Saviour
 Was born upon this day,
 To save us all from Satan's power
 When we were gone astray:

[C1]
   O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
   O tidings of comfort and joy.

[V2]
 From God our heavenly Father
 A blessed angel came,
 And unto certain shepherds
 Brought tidings of the same,
 How that in Bethlehem was born
 The Son of God by name:

[V3]
 The shepherds at those tidings
 Rejoiced much in mind,
 And left their flocks a-feeding
 In tempest, storm and wind,
 And went to Bethlehem straightway,
 This blessed Babe to find:

[V4]
 But when to Bethlehem they came,
 Whereat this Infant lay,
 They found Him in a manger,
 Where oxen feed on hay;
 His mother Mary kneeling,
 Unto the Lord did pray:

[V5]
 Now to the Lord sing praises,
 All you within this place,
 And with true love and brotherhood
 Each other now embrace;
 This holy tide of Christmas
 All other doth deface:</lyrics>
