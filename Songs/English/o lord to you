<lyrics>[V1]
.                 A2
 We will seek You first, Lord.
.                  C#m
 You will hear our voices
.             A
 Early in the morning
.    B7sus       E
 And late in the night.
.                  A2
 We will sing Your praises,
.               C#m
 Giving You the glory,
.             A
 Offering our lives to You,
.  B7sus     E
 A holy sacrifice.

[C1]
.          C#m     A       B E
   May our praise arise as incense,
.    A            B
   O Lord, to You.
.          C#m     A    B  E
   May our worship be a fragrance,
.    A            B
   O Lord, to You.</lyrics>
