.           F                               C       G
 A thousand times I've failed, still Your mercy remains.
.                F                       C              G
 And should I stumble again, still I'm caught in Your grace.
.      Am            F                    C         G
 Everlasting, Your light will shine when all else fades.
.      Am            F           C        G
 Neverending, Your glory goes beyond all fame.

[P1]
.  F                   C                  Am
   In my heart, in my soul, I give You control.
.                        G
   Consume me from the inside out, Lord.
.  F                 Am                 G
   Let justice and praise become my embrace,
.                         Dm
   To love You from the inside out.

[C1]
.        Am            F                    C         G
   Everlasting, Your light will shine when all else fades.
.        Am            F            C       G
   Neverending, Your glory goes beyond all fame.
.           C         F            G         Am
   And the cry of my heart is to bring You praise.
.             F    G              F          G
   From the inside out, Lord, my soul cries out.

[V2]
 Your will above all else my purpose remains,
 The art of losing myself in bringing You praise.
 Everlasting, Your light will shine when all else fades.
 Neverending, Your glory goes beyond all fame.</lyrics>
