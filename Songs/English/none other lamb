<lyrics>[V1]
 None other Lamb, none other name, None other hope in Heav'n or earth or sea, None other hiding place from guilt and shame, None beside Thee!

[V2]
 My faith burns low, my hope burns low; Only my heart's desire cries out in me By the deep thunder of its want and woe, Cries out to Thee.

[V3]
 Lord, Thou art life, though I be dead; Love's fire Thou art, however cold I be: Nor Heav'n have I, nor place to lay my head, Nor home, but Thee.</lyrics>
