<lyrics>[V1]
 The cloud received Christ from their sight. They stood, their mouths agape. Reminded of the things He taught His people still do wait.

[V2]
 The cloud kept safe God's people as Through the dry sea they trod, And led them through the wilderness; They truly walked with God!

[V3]
 On Sinai's height the cloud did rest To make a home below. The Ark first then His written Word His presence now would show.

[V4]
 Appearing on the mercy seat within the inmost place, the Temple showed God's promises to save our fallen race.

[V5]
 On mountain high Christ's face did shine like sun, a blazing light. The cloud once more appeared on earth a truly fearful sight.

[V6]
 While here in flesh You taught us, Lord
 The object sure and right:
 To see our Father's glory bright,
 To have eternal life.

[V7]
 A goal beyond our reach You've shown;
 We cannot pay the price.
 No work of ours atones for sin,
 We cannot set things right.

[V8]
 You are the Truth, You are the Way
 for us to see His face.
 You died for us a sinner's death
 abandoned in our place.

[V9]
 On Easter day, Lord, You were raised
 Firstfruits of our new Life;
 And in the cloud we see the day
 When joy will end all strife.

[V10]
 We wait to see the cloud's return
 To be with us below,
 When You fulfill Your promises
 To bring us to Your home.

[V11]
 And though we wait to see You now
 We know that You are near.
 Your promises to build our faith
 Are stronger than our fear.

[V12]
 You give us faith by Your strong Word
 In water, wine, and bread.
 The Spirit works through earthly means,
 in pastures green we're fed.</lyrics>
