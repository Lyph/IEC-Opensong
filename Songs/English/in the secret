<lyrics>[V1]
.G                           C
 In the secret, in the quiet place,
.Em                D       C
 In the stillness, You are there.
.G                           C
 In the secret, in the quiet hour
 I wait, only for You,
.Em               D        C
 'Cause I want to know You more.

[C1]
.  G         D         Em        C
   I want to know You, I want to hear Your voice;
.  G          D        C
   I want to know You more.
.  G          D        Em        C
   I want to touch You, I want to see Your face;
.  G         D        C
   I want to know You more.

[V2]
.G                             C
 I am reaching for the highest goal,
.Em             D         C
 That I might receive the prize.
.G                              C
 Pressing onward, pushing every hindrance
 aside, out of my way,
.Em               D        C
 'Cause I want to know You more.</lyrics>
