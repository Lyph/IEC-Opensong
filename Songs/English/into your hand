<title>Into Your Hand</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Into Your hand
 I commit again
 With all I am
 For You Lord
 You hold my world
 In the palm of Your hand
 And I am Yours forever

[V2]
 Jesus I believe in You
 Jesus I belong to You
 You're the reason that I live
 the reason that I sing
 with all I am

[V3]
 I'll walk with You
 wherever You go
 through tears and joy
 I'll trust in You
 And I will live
 in all of Your ways and
 Your promises forever
 I will worship, I will worship You forever</lyrics>
<aka>With All I Am</aka>
