.E9                     C#m                             D
 Scorn the use of Jesus name, bid farewell to guilt and shame,
.                        A                         E9
 You assault me with the lie, as I just stand idly by;
.                          C#m                               D
 I will scream for earthly things, but won't whisper for the King,
.                           A                          E9
 You are right the Truth is dead, when I keep it in my head.

[C1]
.  E      C#m         B              A
   Why am I afraid of livin' out the Truth?
.  E         C#m         B             A
   When I am dying of my sin sweetened tooth;
.  E        C#m             B              A
   Though I fall I'll never fall away from You, so
.  E      C#m         B              A
   Why am I afraid of living out the Truth?

[V2]
.E9                    C#m                          D
 I forsake my Savior's might, as I push Him from my sight,
.                      A                           E9
 All alone I choose to stay, hidden deep within my cave;
.                           C#m                              D
 Could I leave and face the storm with a faith that's so lukewarm?
.                         A                          E9
 It's a fence too thin to ride, hot or cold I must decide.</lyrics>
