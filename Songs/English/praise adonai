 Who is like Him
 The Lion and the Lamb
 Seated on the throne
 Mountains bow down
 Every ocean roars
 To the Lord of hosts

[C1]
   Praise Adonai
   From the rising of the sun
   'Til the end of every day
   Praise Adonai
   All the nations of the earth
   All the angels and the saints
   Sing praise</lyrics>
