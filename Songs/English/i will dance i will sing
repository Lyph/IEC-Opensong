.D             G
 I will dance, I will sing
.      D/F# A/E       A
 To be mad  for my King.
.D               G
 Nothing Lord is hindering
.            D/F#  A/E  A
 The passion in my soul.

[C1]
.      D    G
   And I'll become
.       D/F# A/E    A         D    G
   even more undignified than this.
.             D/F#     A/E    A
   Some would say it's foolishness but
.  D       G
   I'll become
.       D/F# A/E    A         D    G
   even more undignified than this,
.  D/F#     A/E         A
   Leave my pride by my side.

[B1]
.  D              G
   Na na na na na na. Hey!
.  D              G
   Na na na na na na. Hey!</lyrics>
