 And beyond the horizon with mercy for today

 You Father the orphan
.Em                          G
 Your kindness makes us whole

 And you shoulder our weakness
.         A
 And your strength becomes our own

 Now you're making me like you
.                    G
 Clothing me in white
.                          F#m
 Bringing beauty from ashes
.                       A
 For You will have Your bride

[P2]

   And known by her true name and it's why I sing
