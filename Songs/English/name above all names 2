 Rulers will one day be silent,
 Lost in the wonder and awe of Your name,
 The wonder and awe of Your name.
 Eternal, none is Your equal.
 We cry no other God but You,
 no other God but You.

   Every knee will bow, every knee must bow,

   Every knee must bow to    You.
.                  A/C# D2 .            B/D# E
   Every knee will bow, every knee must bow,
.                  C#m F#m . D2
   Every knee must bow to    You, yes, to You.</lyrics>
