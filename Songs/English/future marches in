 While the truth screams out
 Don't fear the future shaking up this ground
 There's a freedom that marches in a different sound
 So if you have the choice
 If you have the voice
 Then lift your voice and sing

[V2]
 If you have the breath
 Lift up your voice and sing
 If you have the heart
 Lift up your voice and sing
 If you have the faith
 Lift up your voice and sing
 If you have the love
 Now's the time to use it

[V3]
 Look back no further than the Savior's cross
 Look to the future like the grave is lost
 There's a promise returning all the stolen years
 There's nothing left to fear
 Now the King is here
 So lift your voice and sing

[V4]
 If you have the breath
 Lift up your voice and sing
 If you have the heart
 Lift up your voice and sing
 If you have the faith
 Lift up your voice and sing
 If you have the love
 Now's the time to use it</lyrics>
