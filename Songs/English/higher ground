.G                   D/A    C
 I'm pressing on the upward way,
.                G       G/B   D
 New heights I'm gaining every day;
.              G      D/A    C
 Still praying as I'm onward bound,
.               G/D         D  G
 &quot;Lord plant my feet on higher ground.&quot;

[V2]
.G                 D/A     C
 My heart has no desire to stay
.              G        G/B      D
 Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
.              G           D/A    C
 Tho' some may dwell where these abound,
.              G/D         D  G
 My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

[V3]
.G               D/A      C
 I want to live above the world,
.             G        G/B    D
 Tho' Satan's darts at me are hurled;
.              G          D/A    C
 For faith has caught the joyful sound,
.            G/D           D  G
 The song of saints on higher ground.

[V4]
.G                   D/A    C
 I want to scale the utmost height
.            G        G/B   D
 And catch a gleam of glory bright;
.               G          D/A         C
 But still I'll pray 'till heav'n I've found,
.              G/D       D  G
 &quot;Lord lead me on to higher ground.&quot;

[C1]
.                G             D
   Lord, lift me up and let me stand
.                             G
   By faith on heaven's table-land;
.                             C
   A higher plane than I have found
.                 G/D         D  G
   Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.</lyrics>
