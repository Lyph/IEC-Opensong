.E          B4                A2         B4
 I stand to praise You, but I fall on my knees.
.E            B4              A2          B4
 My spirit is willing, but my flesh is so weak.

[C1]
.                A2
   So, light the fire (echo)
.        B4
   In my soul. (echo)
.          A2
   Fan the flame, (echo)
.          B4
   Make me whole. (make my spirit whole)
.            A2
   Lord, You know (echo)
.          B4
   Where I am, (where I've been)
.               A2         B4    E
   So light the fire in my heart again.

[V2]
.  E              B4                A2                        B4
 I feel Your arms around me, as the power of your healing begins.
.     E                  B4
 Your spirit moves right through me
.       A2             B4
 like a mighty rushing wind.

[B1]
.               A2         B4    E
   So light the fire in my heart again.</lyrics>
