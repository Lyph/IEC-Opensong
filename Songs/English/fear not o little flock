 Fear not, O little flock, the foe Who madly seeks your overthrow; Dread not his rage and pow'r; What though your courage sometimes faints, His seeming triumph o'er God's saints Lasts but one little hour.

[V2]
 Be of good cheer; your cause belongs To Him who can avenge your wrongs; Leave it to Him our Lord. Though hidden yet from all our eyes, He sees the Gideon who shall rise; To save us, and His word.

[V3]
 As true as God's own word is true, Not earth nor hell with all their crew Against us shall prevail. A jest and by\word are they grown; God is with us, we are His own, Our vict'ry cannot fail.

[V4]
 Amen, Lord Jesus, grant our prayer! Great Captain, now Thine arm make bare; Fight for us once again. So shall thy saints and martyrs raise A mighty chorus to Thy praise, World without end. Amen.</lyrics>
