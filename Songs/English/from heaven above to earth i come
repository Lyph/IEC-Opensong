 From Heaven above to earth I come, To bear good news to every home; Glad tidings of great joy I bring, Whereof I now will say and sing.

[V2]
 To you, this night, is born a Child Of Mary, chosen mother mild; This tender Child of lowly birth, Shall be the joy of all your earth.

[V3]
 'Tis Christ our God, Who far on high Had heard your sad and bitter cry; Himself will your Salvation be, Himself from sin will make you free.

[V4]
 He brings those blessings long ago Prepared by God for all below; That in His heavenly kingdom blest You may with us forever rest.

[V5]
 These are the tokens ye shall mark, The swaddling clothes and manger dark; There shall ye find the young Child laid, By Whom the heav'ns and earth were made.

[V6]
 Now let us all, with gladsome cheer,
 Follow the shepherds, and draw near
 To see this wondrous Gift of God,
 Who hath His own dear Son bestowed.

[V7]
 Give heed, my heart, lift up thine eyes!
 What is it in yon manger lies?
 Who is this Child, so young and fair?
 The bless√®d Christ Child lieth there!

[V8]
 Welcome to earth, Thou noble Guest,
 Through Whom e'en wicked men are blest!
 Thou com'st to share our misery,
 What can we render, Lord, to Thee!

[V9]
 Ah, Lord, Who hast created all,
 How hast Thou made Thee weak and small,
 To lie upon the coarse dry grass,
 The food of humble ox and ass.

[V10]
 Were earth a thousand times as fair,
 Beset with gold and jewels rare,
 She yet were far too poor to be
 A narrow cradle, Lord, for Thee.

[V11]
 For velvets soft and silken stuff
 Thou hast but hay and straw so rough,
 Whereon Thou King, so rich and great,
 As 'twere Thy heaven, art throned in state.

[V12]
 Thus hath it pleased Thee to make plain
 The truth to us, poor fools and vain,
 That this world's honor, wealth and might
 Are naught and worthless in Thy sight.

[V13]
 Ah, dearest Jesus, holy Child,
 Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled,
 Here in my poor heart's inmost shrine,
 That I may evermore be Thine.

[V14]
 My heart for very joy doth leap,
 My lips no more can silence keep,
 I too must sing, with joyful tongue,
 That sweetest ancient cradle song.

[V15]
 Glory to God in highest Heaven,
 Who unto man His Son hath given,
 While angels sing, with pious mirth,
 A glad New Year to all the earth.</lyrics>
