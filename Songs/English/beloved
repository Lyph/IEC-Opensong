.C
 Love of My life, look deep in My eyes;
.                             F
 There you will find what you need.
.C
 Give Me your life, the lust and the lies,
.                               F
 The past you're afraid I might see.
.            A#                G
 You've been running away from Me.

[C1]
.              Am  F            C     G
   You're my beloved, lover I'm yours.
.                  Am      F                G
   Death shall not part us; it's you I died for.
.                Am  F                C  G
   For better or worse, forever we'll be.
.               Am       F                    G
   Our love it unites us, and it binds you to Me;
.              Am FCG
   It's a mystery.

[V2]
 Love of My life, look deep in My eyes;
 There you will find what you need.
 I'm the Giver of Life, I'll clothe you in white;
 My immaculate bride you will be.
 Oh, come running home to Me.

[B1]
.              F                   C
   Well you've been a mistress, My wife.
.                 Am           G          Am
   You're chasing lovers, that won't satisfy.
.            F/G                Am
   Won't you let Me make you My bride?
.           F                           G
   You will drink of my lips and you'll taste new life.</lyrics>
