<lyrics>[V1]
.  E
 I waited patiently for the Lord;
.     A
 He inclined and heard my cry.
.   E
 He brought me up out of the pit,
.    A
 out of the miry clay.

[C1]
.         E              A
   I will sing, sing a new song.
.         E              A
   I will sing, sing a new song.
.        E                 A
   How long to sing this song?
.        E                 A
   How long to sing this song?
.        E         A         B
   How long, how long, how long,
.        A                 E
   How long to sing this song?

[V2]
.   E
 He set my feet upon a rock,
.    A
 and made my footsteps firm.
.  E
 Many will see,
.          A
 Many will see and fear.</lyrics>
