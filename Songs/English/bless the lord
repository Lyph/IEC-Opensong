.            C           G
   Bless the Lord, O my soul,

   O my soul,
.  C            G      A
   Worship His holy name

   I'll worship Your holy name

[V1]
.    C         G          D        Em
 The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning;
.C             G           D      Em
  It's time to sing Your song again
.    C        G             D           Em
 Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me,
.C2          G                Dsus4 D     G   Gsus4 G
  Let me be singing when the even   - ing comes.

[V2]
.       C       G                D       Em
 You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger
.     C       G               D          Em
 Your name is great, and Your heart is kind
.    C        G                D        Em
 For all Your goodness, I will keep on singing;
.C2            G              Dsus4 D  G   Gsus4 G
  Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find

[V3]
.    C       G           D            Em
 And on that day when my strength is failing,
.    C         G            D          Em
 The end draws near, and my time has come;
.C        G                   D        Em
 Still my soul will sing Your praise unending;
.C2            G                 Dsus4 D G  Gsus4 G
  Ten thousand years and then forever__mor__e!____</lyrics>
