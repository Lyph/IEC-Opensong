<lyrics>[V1]
 Anytime a heart turns from darkness to light
 Anytime temptation comes and someone stands to fight
 Anytime somebody lives to serve and not be served
 I know, I know, I know, I know

[C1]
   God is on the move, on the move Hallelujah
   God is on the move in many mighty ways
   God is on the move, on the move Hallelujah
   God is on the move on the move today

[V2]
 Anytime in weakness someone falls upon their knees
 Or dares to speak the truth that sets men free
 Anytime the choice is made to stand upon the Word
 I know, I know, I know, I know

[B1]
   I see a generation standing on the truth
   In each and every nation God is on the move
   Anytime the gospel stirs a searching soul
   And someone says, &quot;Send me, here I go&quot;
   I know, I know, I know, I know</lyrics>
