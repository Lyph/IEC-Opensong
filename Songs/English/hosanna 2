.D
 I see the king of glory
.Bm
 Coming on the clouds with fire
.                Em                      F#m   Bmx2
 The whole earth shakes, the whole earth shakes
.D                         Bm
 I see his love and mercy, washing over all our sin
.           Em               A
 The people sing, the people sing

[C1]
.    F#m G    A  Bm
   Hosanna, hosanna
.     G           Bm  A
   Hosanna in the highest
.    F#m G    A  Bm
   Hosanna, hosanna
.     G       A       Bm D Em F#m
   Hosanna in the highest

[V2]
.D
 I see a generation
.Bm
 Rising up to take the place
.              Em                   F#m
 With selfless faith, with selfless faith
.D                      Bm
 I see a fresh revival, Stirring as we pray and seek
.             Em                  A
 We're on our knees, we're on our knees

[B1]
.  G                         A
   Heal my heart and make it clean
.  D                      Bm
   Open up my eyes to the things unseen
.  G                        A              Bm
   Show me how to love like you have loved me
.  G                              A
   Break my heart for what breaks yours
.  D                        Bm
   Everything I am for your kingdom's cause
.  G                      A        G
   As I walk from earth into eternity</lyrics>
