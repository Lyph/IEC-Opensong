 Come Holy Spirit, fall on us
 Burn like a fire
 Living flame of love

[V2]
 We're on our knees, holy God
 Show us Your glory, oh God
 We're on our knees
 Crying for heaven to come to earth

[V3]
 Father God Your will be done
 Christ in us Your Kingdom come
 Spirit lead us now as one
 Set Your church on fire again</lyrics>
