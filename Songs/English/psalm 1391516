<lyrics>[V1]
 My frame was not hidden from you,
 when I was being made in secret,
 intricately woven in the depths of the earth.
 Your eyes saw my unformed substance;

[V2]
 My frame was not hidden from you,
 when I was being made in secret,
 intricately woven in the depths of the earth.
 Your eyes saw my unformed substance;

[V3]
 in your book were written,
 every one of them,
 the days that were formed for me,
 when as yet there was none of them.

[V4]
 in your book were written,
 every one of them,
 the days that were formed for me,
 when as yet there was none of them.

[V5]
 in your book were written,
 every one of them,
 the days that were formed for me,
 when as yet there was none of them.

[V6]
 in your book were written,
 every one of them,
 the days that were formed for me,
 when as yet there was none of them.

[V7]
 My frame was not hidden from you,
 when I was being made in secret,
 intricately woven in the depths of the earth.
 Your eyes saw my unformed substance;

[V8]
 My frame was not hidden from you,
 when I was being made in secret,
 intricately woven in the depths of the earth.
 Your eyes saw my unformed substance;

[V9]
 in your book were written,
 every one of them,
 the days that were formed for me,
 when as yet there was none of them.

[V10]
 in your book were written,
 every one of them,
 the days that were formed for me,
 when as yet there was none of them.</lyrics>
