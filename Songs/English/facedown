 Welcomed into the courts of the King,

 Lord, I stand on Your merciful ground,

 Yet with every step tread with reverence.

[C1]

 Who is there in the heavens like You?
.     Cmaj7                     D2
 And upon the earth, who's Your equal?
.        Am                    E
 You are far above, You're the highest of heights;
.       Cmaj7          D2
 We are bowing down to exalt you.

   Let Your glory shine around.
.                        G
   King of glory here be found. King of glory.

[B2]
.  Am                E
   Welcomed into the courts of the King,
.      Cmaj7              D2
   I am ushered into your presence.</lyrics>
