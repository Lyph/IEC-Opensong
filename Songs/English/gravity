 [Verse 1]
 I get caught up
 In all these petty things
 Losing sight of what matters to You
 But then You come
 And take me by the hand
 You say, &quot;Come up here with me&quot;

[V2]
 [Chorus]
 And then my feet came off the ground
 You lifted me above the clouds
 As I look down the whole world seemed so small
 Past the stars through space and time
 And I forget what's left behind
 As I'm surrounded by these grander things
 Up here in perfect harmony
 You're orchestrating galaxies
 They're lighting up as far as I can see
 The majesty
 The mystery

[V3]
 [Verse 2]
 Your gravity
 Pulls me close to You
 And I can breathe again
 Here with You
 There's nothing more to say
 And it's clear what matters to You

[V4]
 Woah-ohh ... oh-ohh-ohhh
 Woah-ohh ... oh-ohh
 Woah-ohh ... oh-ohh-ohhh
 Woah-ohh ... oh-ohh

[V5]
 [Bridge 1]
 Sovereign
 High above it all
 Sovereign You are
 And I can rest
 'Cause it's all in Your hands
 Sovereign You are

[V6]
 [Instrumental]

[V7]
 [Bridge 2]
 Sovereign
 High above it all
 Sovereign You are
 And I can rest
 It's all in Your hands
 Sovereign You are</lyrics>
