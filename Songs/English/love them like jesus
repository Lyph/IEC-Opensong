<lyrics>[V1]
 The love of her life is drifting away
 They're losing the fight for another day
 The life that she's known is falling apart
 A fatherless home, a child's broken heart

[P1]
   You're holding her hand, you're straining for words
   You trying to make - sense of it all
   She's desperate for hope, darkness clouding her view
   She's looking to you

[C1]
   Just love her like Jesus, carry her to Him
   His yoke is easy, His burden is light
   You don't need the answers to all of life's questions
   Just know that He loves her and stay by her side

[V2]
 Love her like Jesus
 Love her like Jesus

[V3]
 The gifts lie in wait, in a room painted blue
 Little blessing from Heaven would be there soon
 Hope fades in the night, blue skies turn to gray
 As the little one slips away

[P2]
   You're holding her hand, you're straining for words
   You're trying to make sense of it all
   They're desperate for hope, darkness clouding their view
   They're looking to you

[C2]
   Just love them like Jesus, carry them to Him
   His yoke is easy, His burden is light
   You don't need the answers to all of life's questions
   Just know that He loves them and stay by their side
   Love them like Jesus

[B1]
   Lord of all creation holds our lives in His hands
   The God of all the nations holds our lives in His hands
   The Rock of our salvation holds our lives in His hands
   He cares for them just as He cares for you

[C3]
   So love them like Jesus, love them like Jesus
   You don't need the answers to all of life's questions
   Just know that He loves them and stay by their side
   Love them like Jesus
   Love them like Jesus</lyrics>
