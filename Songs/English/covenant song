.D2               G/B     C2    D2                 G
 We belong to the Lion of Judah; we are Abraham's seed
.D2               G/B       C2        D2       G/BC2G
 We belong to the God and creator of everything
.D2                G/B       C2    D2                       G
 Let us raise up a covenant chorus; let us bring forth our lives
.D2                    G/B      C2           D2            G/BC2D2
 To the one whose host gathers among us and fills the skies

.  G          A7sus          D2
    And raise up His name on high
.  G,G/F# A7sus                   D2
    Raise up, you people of His pride
.  G      Em7             C2
    Raise up and bear the fire that's in our eyes
.             G/B          C2                       DG/BCG
   And in our lives and shows that we are not afraid

[V2]
.D2                  G/B      C2     D2                    G
 In His light we can never be hidden; in His love we are healed
.D2                        G/B          C2     D2       G/BC2D2
 We will shine through the night like a city upon a hill

[C2]
.  G         A7sus          D2
    So raise up His name on high
.  G,G/F# A7sus                   D2
    Raise up, you people of His pride
.  G      Em7             C2
    Raise up and bear the fire that's in our eyes
.             G/B          C2                       D2G/BCG
   And in our lives and shows that we are not afraid
.                    D2/B C2                   D2G/BCG
   No we are not afraid;   no we are not afraid

[V3]
 He delivers his people from bondage, sets the prisoner free
 He has given us love and salvation, His eternal legacy
 He will spare us the sword of His anger; he prepares us a home
 Where we'll worship in glory forever before His throne</lyrics>
