 When I consider what You have made
 The mighty oceans, the fiery stars
 The fields and forests give You praise
 My Lord, my God

[C1]
   I stand in awe, I stand in awe
   I stand in awe of You

[V2]
 When I consider what You have done
 I see Your suffering, I see Your scars
 Oh, the wonder, and oh, the love
 My Lord (My Lord), my God (My God)

[C2]
   And I stand in awe, yes, I stand in awe
   I stand in awe of You

[B1]
   All glory, all honor, all worship and all praise
   All blessing, all power how worthy is Your name
   All glory, all honor, all worship and all my praise
   All blessing, all power, Is Yours all the power is Yours

[C3]
   And I stand in awe, I stand in awe
   I stand in awe of You (I stand in awe of You)
   God, I stand in awe, yes, I stand in awe
   I stand in awe of You
   Awe I stand in awe</lyrics>
