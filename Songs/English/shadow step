 CHORUS
 Tracing all my steps
 Light up the way of Your heart
 Move me like You do the mountains
 Move me like You do the wind
 And I'll chase Your voice through the dark
 Fix my eyes on the unexpected
 In the wonder of Your shadow-step
 (Take another step)

[V2]
 VERSE 1
 You met me at the sinners' table
 I found You waiting by the well
 Unexpected
 You are always there

[V3]
 VERSE 2
 You never left the lost forsaken
 Your mercy paves the road ahead
 Unexpected
 You are always good
 You are always good

[V4]
 POST-CHORUS
 And I won't be afraid
 In every way
 You never fail
 So have Your way here God
 And I'll sing Your praise
 Fix my heart to Yours
 Ready for the unexpected
 Ready for what You will do next

[V5]
 BRIDGE
 I can't explain Your heart
 Or dare to trace-out all You are
 But when I think about
 The road You took for love
 I know Your grace will stay the path</lyrics>
