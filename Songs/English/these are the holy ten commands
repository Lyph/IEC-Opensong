<lyrics>[V1]
 That man a godly life might live, God did these ten commandments give By His true servant Moses, high Upon the mount Sinai. Have mercy, Lord.

[V2]
 I am thy God and Lord alone, No other God besides Me own; On My great mercy venture thee, With all thy heart love thou Me.

[V3]
 By idle word and speech profane Take not My holy Name in vain; And praise not aught as good and true But what God doth say and do.

[V4]
 Hallow the day which God hath blest, That thou and all thy house may rest; Keep hand and heart from labor free, That God may so work in thee.

[V5]
 Give to thy parents honor due, Be dutiful and loving too; And help them when their strength decays So shalt thou have length of days.

[V6]
 Kill thou not out of evil will,
 Nor hate, nor render ill for ill;
 Be patient and of gentle mood,
 And to thy foe do thou good.

[V7]
 Be faithful to thy marriage vows,
 Thy heart give only to thy spouse
 Keep thy life pure, and lest thou sin
 Keep thyself with discipline.

[V8]
 Steal not; oppressive acts abhor;
 Nor wring their life-blood from the poor;
 But open wide thy loving hand
 To all the poor in the land.

[V9]
 Bear not false witness, nor belie
 Thy neighbor by foul calumny;
 Defend his innocence from blame,
 With charity hide his shame.

[V10]
 Thy neighbor's wife desire thou not,
 His house, nor aught that he hath got
 But wish that his such good may be
 As thy heart doth wish for thee.

[V11]
 God these commandments gave, therein
 To show thee, son of man, thy sin,
 And make thee also well perceive
 How man for God ought to live.

[V12]
 Help us, Lord Jesus Christ, for we A Mediator have in Thee;
 Without Thy help our works so vain Merit naught but endless pain.</lyrics>
