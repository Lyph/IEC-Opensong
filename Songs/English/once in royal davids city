.F    C  F     C       F
 Once in royal David's city,
.F    Dm F     Bb  C  F
 stood a lowly cattle shed
.F     C F      G        C F
 Where a mother laid her baby,
.F Dm F      Bb  C   F
 in a manger for His bed
.Bb   F        C      F
 Mary was that mother mild,
.Bb    F          Bb C   F
 Jesus Christ her little child

[V2]
.F  C    F       C          F
 He came down to earth from heaven,
.F   Dm F       Bb   C  F
 who is God and Lord of all
.F   C   F       G     C  F
 And His shelter was a stable,
.F   Dm  F      Bb  C   F
 and His cradle was a stall
.Bb       F        C        F
 With the poor and mean and lowly,
.Bb       F         Bb C    F
 lived on earth our Saviour holy

[V3]
.F   C       F       C        F
 And through all His wondrous childhood,
.F  Dm    F      Bb  C  F
 He would honour and obey
.F    C   F         G     C F
 Love and watch the lowly mother,
.F  Dm    F      Bb   C  F
 in whose gentle arms He lay
.Bb        F        C          F
 Christian children all should be,
.Bb     F        Bb   C  F
 kind, obedient, good as He

[V4]
.F   C  F      C           F
 For He is our childhood's pattern,
.F   Dm F        Bb C  F
 day by day like us He grew
.F  C   F       G        C   F
 He was little, weak and helpless,
.F     Dm  F           Bb C  F
 tears and smiles like us He knew
.Bb     F         C       F
 And He feels for all our sadness,
.Bb     F         Bb  C   F
 and He shares in all our gladness

[V5]
.F   C   F       C          F
 And our eyes at last shall see Him,
.F       Dm  F     Bb C    F
 through His own redeeming love
.F   C    F        G        C   F
 For that Child so dear and gentle,
.F  Dm  F       Bb     C  F
 is our Lord in heaven above
.Bb     F         C        F
 And He leads His children on,
.Bb     F           Bb C  F
 to the place where He is gone

[V6]
.F   C  F         C     F
 Not in that poor lowly stable,
.F    Dm  F    Bb  C    F
 with the oxen standing by
.F  C     F       G      C  F
 We shall see Him but in heaven,
.F   Dm F           Bb   C  F
 set at God's right hand on high
.Bb        F        C      F
 There His children gather round,
.Bb          F           Bb C  F
 bright like stars, with glory crowned</lyrics>
