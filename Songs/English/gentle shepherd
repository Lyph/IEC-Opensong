.       D                 Bm
 Gentle Shepherd come and lead us,
.       A                            D
 For we need You to help us find our way,
.       D                 Bm
 Gentle Shepherd come and feed us,
.       A                              D
 For we need Your strength from day to day.

.           F#m          Em
 There's no other we can turn to,
.        F#m                  A
 Who can help us face another day,
.       D                 Bm
 Gentle Shepherd come and lead us,
.       A                            D
 For we need You to help us find our way.</lyrics>
