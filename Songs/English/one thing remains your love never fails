 Higher than the mountains I face
 Stronger than the power of the grave
 Constant in the trial and the change
 One thing remains
 One thing remains

[V2]
  Your love
 Your love
 Your love will never change

[C1]
    / Your love never fails in never gives up never runs out on me /x3
   Your love

[V3]
  On and on and on and on it goes
 It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
 And I never ever have to be afraid
 One thing remains
 One thing remains

[B1]
    In death in life I'm confident and covered by
   The power of Your great love
   My debt is paid there's nothing that can separate
   My heart from Your great love</lyrics>
