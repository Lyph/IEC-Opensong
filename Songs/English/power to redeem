 You take what is
 And you make it beautiful
 When love floods in,
 We're restored forever more

[C1]
   With breath that brings the dead to life,
   With words that pierce the dark with light
   Only by the blood are we set free.
   With mercy strong to carry shame
   And nail it to a tree You alone
   Hold the power to redeem.

[V2]
 No guilt competes
 With innocence crucified.
 No grave can hold
 What your grace has justified.

[C2]
   With breath that brings the dead to life,
   With words that pierce the dark with light
   Only by the blood are we set free.
   With mercy strong to carry shame
   And nail it to a tree You alone
   Hold the power to redeem.

[B1]
   Rejoice oh child of God
   Lift your eyes to see
   With every morning light,
   Again we are redeemed

[C3]
   With breath it brings the dead to life,
   With words that pierce the dark with light
   Only by the blood are we set free.
   With mercy strong to carry shame
   And nail it to a tree You alone
   Hold the power to redeem.

[V3]
 Oh you alone, hold the power to redeem.
 Oh you alone, hold the power to redeem.
 Oh you alone, hold the power to redeem.</lyrics>
