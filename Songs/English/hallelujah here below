 We are an altar of broken stones
 But You delight in the offering
 You have the heavens to call Your home
 But You abide in the song we sing

[V2]
 Ten thousand angels surround Your throne
 To bring You praise that will never cease
 But hallelujah from here below
 Is still Your favourite melody

[C1]
   We sing hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
   We sing hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

[V3]
 And should the fire that once burned bright
 Become an ember my eyes can't see
 I will remember Your sacrifice
 I will abide in Your love for me

[B1]
   Jesus Christ our King enthroned
   All the praise is Yours forevermore
   Hallelujah here below
   All the praise is Yours forevermore
   Jesus Christ our King enthroned
   All the praise is Yours forevermore
   Hallelujah here below
   All the praise is Yours forevermore

[V4]
 Oh, what a wonderful day to come
 When every knee bows before Your name
 But we will not wait until it does
 For here and now shall Your Kingdom reign</lyrics>
