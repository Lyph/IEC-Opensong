 I heard the bells on Christmas day Their old familiar carols play, And wild and sweet the words repeat Of peace on earth, good will to men.

[V2]
 And thought how, as the day had come, The belfries of all Christendom Had rolled along th'unbroken song Of peace on earth, good will to men.

[V3]
 Till ringing, singing on its way The world revolved from night to day, A voice, a chime, a chant sublime Of peace on earth, good will to men.

[V4]
 And in despair I bowed my head &quot;There is no peace on earth,&quot; I said, &quot;For hate is strong and mocks the song Of peace on earth, good will to men.&quot;

[V5]
 Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: &quot;God is not dead, nor doth He sleep; The wrong shall fail, the right prevail With peace on earth, good will to men.&quot;</lyrics>
