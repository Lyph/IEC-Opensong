<lyrics>[V1]
 We know Thee who Thou art, Lord Jesus, Mary's Son; We know the yearnings of Thy heart To end Thy work begun.

[V2]
 That sacred fount of grace, 'Mid all the bliss of Heav'n, Has joy whene'er we seek Thy face, And kneel to be forgiv'n.

[V3]
 Brought home from ways perverse, At peace Thine arms within, We pray Thee, shield us from the curse Of falling back to sin.

[V4]
 We dare not ask to live Henceforth from trials free; But oh! when next they tempt us, give More strength to cling to Thee.

[V5]
 We know Thee who Thou art, Our own redeeming Lord; Be Thou by will, and mind, and heart, Accepted, loved, adored.</lyrics>
