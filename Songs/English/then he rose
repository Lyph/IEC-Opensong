 See Him now, the King of heaven
 Son of God, enthroned above
 Heavy cross upon His shoulders
 Carried for us, carried for us

[V2]
 See Him now, our King surrendered
 Final word of perfect love
 Hear His cry, &quot;Father, forgive them&quot;
 Spoken for us, spoken for us

[P1]
   When He said, &quot;It is finished&quot;
   Oh our hope had just begun

[C1]
   The grave has lost its hold
   Arise the stone is gone
   Our God reigns forevermore
   All praise to Him belongs
   Lift high His name alone
   Jesus came, paid it all
   Then He rose, then He rose

[V3]
 Now we arise by His spirit
 In His name we overcome
 All our hope, in this same power
 Living in us, living in us

[C2]
   2 PreFor our sin is defeated
   Oh the war has now been won

[C3]
   The grave has lost its hold
   Arise the stone is gone
   Our God reigns forevermore
   All praise to Him belongs
   Lift high His name alone
   Jesus came, paid it all
   Then He rose, then He rose

[B1]
   Death, lay your weapons down
   Sin, you're defeated now
   The stone is rolled away
   Our God reigns
   Crown Him with many crowns
   Soon every knee will bow
   The stone is rolled away
   Our God reigns
   Death, lay your weapons down
   Sin, you're defeated now
   The stone is rolled away
   Our God reigns
   Crown Him with many crowns
   Soon every knee will bow
   The stone is rolled away
   Our God reigns

[C4]
   The grave has lost its hold
   Arise the stone is gone
   Our God reigns forevermore
   All praise to Him belongs
   Lift high His name alone
   Jesus came, paid it all
   Then He rose, then He rose</lyrics>
