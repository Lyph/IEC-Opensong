<lyrics>[V1]
 Pass me not, O gentle Savior, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by. Savior, Savior, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by.

[V2]
 Let me at Thy throne of mercy Find a sweet relief, Kneeling there in deep contrition; Help my unbelief. Savior, Savior, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by.

[V3]
 Trusting only in Thy merit, Would I seek Thy face; Heal my wounded, broken spirit, Save me by Thy grace. Savior, Savior, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by.

[V4]
 Thou the Spring of all my comfort, More than life to me, Whom have I on earth beside Thee? Whom in Heav'n but Thee? Savior, Savior, Hear my humble cry; While on others Thou art calling, Do not pass me by.</lyrics>
