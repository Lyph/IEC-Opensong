<lyrics>[V1]
 The Word is alive

[V2]
 Looking out from His throne, the Father of light and of men
 Chose to make Himself known and show us the way back to Him
 Speaking wisdom and truth into the hearts of peasants and kings
 He began to unveil the Word that would change the course of all things

[V3]
 With eyes wide open, all would see

[C1]
   The Word is alive and it cuts like a sword through the darkness
   With a message of life to the hopeless and afraid
   Breathing life into all who believe
   The Word is alive and the world and its glories will fade
   But His truth, it will not pass away
   It remains yesterday and forever the same
   The Word is alive

[V4]
 Simple strokes on a page eternity's secrets revealed,
 Carried on from age to age it speaks Truth to us even still
 And as the rain falls from Heaven, feeds the earth before it returns
 Lord, let Your Word fall on us and bring forth the fruit You deserve

[V5]
 With eyes wide open, let us see</lyrics>
