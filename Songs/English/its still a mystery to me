<title>It's still a mystery to me</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 It's still a mystery to me
 That the hands of God could be so small
 How tiny fingers reaching in the night
 Were the very hands that measured the sky

[C1]
   Hallelujah, hallelujah
   Heaven's love reaching down to save the world
   Hallelujah, hallelujah, son of God, servant King
   Here with us, You're here with us

[V2]
 It's still a mystery to me
 How His infant eyes have seen the dawn of time
 How His ears have heard an angel's symphony
 But still Mary had to rock her Savior to sleep

[V3]
 Jesus, the Christ, born in Bethlehem
 A baby born to save, to save the souls of man</lyrics>
