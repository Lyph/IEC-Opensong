<title>When You Think of Me (Live)</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 When You think of me
 When You hear my name
 When You see my face
 Let it be mercy

[V2]
 When thoughts of me come to Your memory

[V3]
 Oh my story told
 Let it be mercy

[V4]
 Don't remember me according to my sin

[V5]
 But remember me with compassion
 When my voice is heard around Your throne
 Let it strike Your heart with love alone

[V6]
 When You think of me
 When You hear my name
 When You see my face
 Let it be mercy

[V7]
 When thoughts of me come to Your memory

[V8]
 Oh my story told
 Let it be mercy

[V9]
 When I stand face to face and look You in the eyes

[V10]
 See my heart, see my soul and how I fought the fight
 Blot out my sin when You look at me
 Let my life be a treasured memory

[V11]
 When You think of me
 When You hear my name
 When You see my face
 Let it be mercy

[V12]
 When thoughts of me come to Your memory

[V13]
 Oh my story told
 Let it be mercy</lyrics>
