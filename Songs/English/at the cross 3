<lyrics>[V1]
 [Verse]
.     Em        D   G        C
 There's a place, where mercy reigns and never dies
.     Em        D     G            C
 There's a place, where streams of grace flows deep and wide

[V2]
.     D       C
 All the love, I've ever found
.      D             C
 Comes like a flood, comes flowing down

[V3]
 [Chorus]
.C
 At the cross, at the cross
.  G
 I surrender my life
.    D           Am
 I'm in awe of you; I'm in awe of you
.    C             G
 Where your love ran red, and my sins washed white
.   D           Am
 I owe all to you, I owe all to you
.C
 Jesus

[V4]
 [Verse]
.    Em        D   G          C
 There's a place, where sin and shame are powerless
.    Em      D       G          C
 Where my heart has peace with God, and forgiveness

[V5]
.     D       C
 All the love, I've ever found
.      D             C
 Comes like a flood, comes flowing down

[V6]
 [Chorus]
.C
 At the cross, at the cross
.  G
 I surrender my life
.    D           Am
 I'm in awe of you; I'm in awe of you
.    C             G
 Where your love ran red, and my sins washed white
.   D           Am
 I owe all to you, I owe all to you
.C
 Jesus

 [Bridge]
.C           Em
 Here my hope is found, here on holy ground

 Here arms open wide, here you saved my life
.G         D
 Here I bow down, here I bow</lyrics>
