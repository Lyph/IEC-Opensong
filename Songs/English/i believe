 1 verse
 In a land far away time stood still long ago
 There were shepherds in fields
 Or at least this is how the story goes
 The story goes

[V2]
 2 verse
 Woman with child and an inn with no room
 Born in a manger foretelling a tomb
 This is how the story goes

[P1]
   But it's more than a fable, and it's more than a fairytale
   And more than my mind can conceive

[C1]
   I believe the wise men saw
   The baby born the angels called the son of God
   Heaven's child, the Great I Am
   Born to take away my sins through nail-pierced hands
   Emmanuel has come, I believe

[V3]
 Two thousand years, still the story lives on
 God's gift to us, sent to earth wrapped in flesh
 His only Son, His only Son

[V4]
 Pre-Chorus
 And the heartbeat of heaven confounded our wisdom
 But it's still the simple truth that sets me free

[C2]
   I believe the people saw
   The man who lived the angels called the son of God
   Heaven's child, the Great I Am
   Came to take away my sins through nail-pierced hands
   Emmanuel has come, and I believe

[B1]
   Precious Lord, how can it be that
   God's great plan for history
   Would send you to the lonely tree
   That you would come for one like me

[C3]
   LastI believe in a cross
   I believe he came for one, he came for all
   The Son of God, the Great I Am
   Gave his life for me and then He rose again
   I believe, I believe, oh I believe
   Jesus lives in me, I believe</lyrics>
