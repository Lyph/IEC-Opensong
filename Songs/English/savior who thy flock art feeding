<lyrics>[V1]
 Savior, who Thy flock art feeding With the Shepherd's kindest care, All the feeble gently leading, While the lambs Thy bosom share.

[V2]
 Now, these little ones receiving, Fold them in Thy gracious arm; There, we know, Thy Word believing, Only there secure from harm.

[V3]
 Never, from Thy pasture roving, Let them be the lion's prey; Let Thy tenderness, so loving, Keep them through life's dang'rous way.

[V4]
 Then within Thy fold eternal Let them find a resting place, Feed in pastures ever vernal, Drink the rivers of Thy grace.</lyrics>
