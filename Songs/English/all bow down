<lyrics>[V1]
.B/D#                     B/D#
 You're arriving with the sound
 of thunder and rain.
.B/D#                   B/D#
 You're arriving in the calm
 of the wind and the waves.
.B/D#
 You're arriving in the glow
.     E
 of a burning flame,
.  B/D#
 A burning flame.

[V2]
 Praise awaits You at the dawn
 when the world comes alive.
 Praise awaits You in the darkness
 and shines in the light.
 Praise awaits You with a song
 of love and desire,
 Love and desire.

[C1]
.       A2                  E
   Here comes the King; all bow down.
.               B/D#
   Lift up your voices unto the Lamb.
.        A2            E
   He is the King; all bow down.
.      B/D#
   All bow down.

[V3]
 You are coming again
 like a thief in the night.
 You are coming again
 with a shout from the sky.
 You are coming again
 to take away Your bride,
 To take away Your bride.

[B1]
.  B/D# A2      E
   Ye___ah, You are the King.
.  B/D# A2      E
   Ye___ah, You are the King.

[C2]
   You are the King; all bow down.
   Lift up your voices unto the Lamb.
   You are the King; all bow down.
   All bow down.</lyrics>
