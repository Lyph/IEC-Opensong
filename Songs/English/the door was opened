 The door was opened
 Your light came flooding
 O'er me, my Lord
 My sinful selfishness
 Was nailed upon the cross
 With you, my Lord

[V2]
 Fill my cup, my Lord God
 Fill my cup, Lord Jesus
 Fill my cup, my heart is empty
 Without you, my Lord

[V3]
 The Word became flesh
 The Truth became known
 Through you, my Lord
 Death was defeated
 I, too, have new life
 With you, my Lord</lyrics>
