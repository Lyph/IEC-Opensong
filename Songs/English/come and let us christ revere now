<lyrics>[V1]
 Come, your hearts and voices raising, Christ the Lord with gladness praising; Loudly sing His love amazing, Worthy folk of Christendom.

[V2]
 Sin and death may well be groaning, Satan now may well be moaning; We, our full salvation owning, Cast our every care away.

[V3]
 See how God, for us providing, Gave His Son and life abiding; He our weary steps is guiding From earth's woe to heav'nly joy.

[V4]
 Christ, from heav'n to us descending And in love our race befriending, In our need His help extending, Saved us from the wily Foe.

[V5]
 Jacob's Star in all its splendor Beams with comfort sweet and tender, Forcing Satan to surrender, Breaking all the pow'rs of hell.

[V6]
 From the bondage that oppressed us,
 From sin's fetters that possessed us,
 From the grief that sore distressed us,
 We, the captives, now are free.

[V7]
 Oh, the joy beyond expressing
 When by faith we grasp this blessing
 And to Thee we come confessing,
 That our freedom thou hast wrought!

[V8]
 Gracious Child, we pray Thee, hear us,
 From Thy lowly manger cheer us,
 Gently lead us and be near us
 Till we join the angelic choir.</lyrics>
