.         D                    A/C#                    E
 It's the song of the redeemed rising from the African plain.
.         D                    A/C#                    E
 It's the song of the forgiven drowning out the Amazon rain.
.            D               A/C#                   E
 The song of Asian believers filled with God's holy fire.
.                        D
 It's ev'ry tribe, ev'ry tongue, ev'ry nation;
.  A/C#                         E
 a love song born of a grateful choir.

[C1]
.  E
   It's all God's children singing,
.   D             A
   &quot;Glory, glory, hallelujah!
.     E
   He reigns, He reigns!&quot;
.  E
   It's all God's children singing,
.   D             A
   &quot;Glory, glory, hallelujah!
.     E
   He reigns, He reigns!&quot;

[V2]
.       D                          A/C#                      E
 Let it rise above the four winds, caught up in the heavenly sound.
.                          D
 Let praises echo from the towers of cathedrals
.       A/C#                   E
 to the faithful gathered underground.
.                               D
 Of all the songs sung from the dawn of creation,
.A/C#                  E
 some were meant to persist.
.                             D
 Of all the bells rung from a thousand steeples,
.A/C#                  E
 none rings truer than this:

[B1]
.              A/E                D/F#                         E
   And all the powers of darkness tremble at what they've just heard,
.                 A/E                D/F#                     E
   'Cause all the powers of darkness can't drown out a single word.</lyrics>
