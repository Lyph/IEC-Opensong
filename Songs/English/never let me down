 Verse: 1
.Em            G
 I've been left alone

   Bridge:
.  E7
   I can see the stars declaring
   (the Lord wont let me down)
   I can hear the rocks are crying
   (the Lord wont let me down)
   I can hear the church bells ringing
   (the Lord wont let me down)
   I can feel the earth is groaning
   (the Lord wont let me down)
   I can hear the people shouting
   (the Lord wont let me down)
   And all the cities are screaming
   (the Lord wont let me down)
   While all the preachers are preaching
   (the Lord wont let me down)
   While all the kings are bowing down
