<lyrics>[V1]
 A great and mighty wonder, a full and holy cure: The virgin bears the Infant with virgin honor pure! Repeat the hymn again: &quot;To God on high be glory And peace on earth to men!&quot;

[V2]
 The Word becomes incarnate and yet remains on high, And cherubim sing anthems to shepherds from the sky. Repeat the hymn again: &quot;To God on high be glory And peace on earth to men!&quot;

[V3]
 While thus they sing your Monarch, those bright angelic bands, Rejoice, ye vales and mountains, ye oceans, clap your hands. Repeat the hymn again: &quot;To God on high be glory And peace on earth to men!&quot;

[V4]
 Since all He comes to ransom, by all be He adored, The Infant born in Bethl'em, the Savior and the Lord. Repeat the hymn again: &quot;To God on high be glory And peace on earth to men!&quot;

[V5]
 And idol forms shall perish, and error shall decay, And Christ shall wield His scepter, our Lord and God for aye. Repeat the hymn again: &quot;To God on high be glory And peace on earth to men!&quot;</lyrics>
