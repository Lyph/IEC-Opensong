 I love you, Lord for your mercy never fails me
 All my days, I've been held in your hands
 From the moment that I wake up till I lay my head
 I will sing of the goodness of God

[C1]
   All my life you have been faithful
   All my life you have been so, so good
   With every breath that I am able
   I will sing of the goodness of God

[V2]
 I love your voice You have led me through the fire
 In darkest night you are close like no other
 I've known you as a father I've known you as a friend
 I have lived in the goodness of God

[B1]
   Your goodness is running after, It's running after me
   Your goodness is running after, It's running after me
   With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now I give you everything
   Your goodness is running after, It's running after me</lyrics>
