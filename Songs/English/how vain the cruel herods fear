<aka>The Star Proclaims the King is Here, Herod Why Dreadest thou a Foe?, When Christ's Appearing Was Made Known, Why Herod Unrelenting Foe, Why Impious Herod, Shouldst Thou Fear</aka>

<lyrics>[V1]
 The star proclaims the King is here; But, Herod, why this senseless fear? He takes no realms of earth away Who gives the realms of heav'nly day.

[V2]
 The wiser Magi see from far And follow on His guiding star; And led by light, to light they press And by their gifts their God confess.

[V3]
 Within the Jordan's crystal flood In meekness stands the Lamb of God And, sinless, sanctifies the wave, Mankind from sin to cleanse and save.

[V4]
 At Cana first His pow'r is shown; His might the blushing waters own And, changing as He speaks the word, Flow wine, obedient to their Lord.

[V5]
 All glory, Jesus, be to Thee For this Thy glad epiphany; Whom with the Father we adore And Holy Ghost forevermore.</lyrics>
