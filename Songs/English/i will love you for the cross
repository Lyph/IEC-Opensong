<lyrics>[V1]
 I will love You for the cross
 And I will love You for the cost
 Man of sufferings
 Bringer of my peace

[V2]
 You came into a world of shame
 And paid the price we could not pay
 Death that brought me life
 Blood that brought me home
 Death that brought me life
 Blood that brought me home

[V3]
 And I love You for the cross
 I'm overwhelmed by the mystery
 I love You for the cost
 That Jesus You would do this for me
 When You were broken, You were beaten,
 You were punished, I go free
 When You were wounded and rejected
 In your mercy, I am healed

[V4]
 Jesus Christ the sinner's friend
 Does this kindness know no bounds?
 With Your precious blood
 You have purchased me
 Oh the mystery of the cross
 You were punished You were crushed
 But that punishment has become my peace
 Yes that punishment has become my peace</lyrics>
