<lyrics>[V1]
.C   C#4  C  C#4          G
 Are we left here on our own?
.C   C#4   C       C#4                  G
 Can you feel when your last breath is gone?

[P1]
.  Em                  C    D
   Night is weighing heavy now.
.  C             D           C              D
   Be quiet and wait for a voice that will say:

[C1]
.         G          D/F#   C
   Come awake, from sleep arise.
.             G     D/F#   C
   You were dead; become alive.
.                  G  D/F#       C
   Wake up, wake up; open your eyes.
.                    G    D/F#      C
   Climb from your grave into the light.
.                    Em
   Bring us back to life.

[V2]
.C   C#4 C   C#4       G
 You are not the only one
.C   C#4    C   C#4       G
 Who feels like the only one.

[P2]
.  Em                  C      D
   Night will soon be lifted, friend.
.       C          D
   Just be quiet, wait
.          C              D
   for a voice that will say:

[B1]
.  C   C#4 C C#4
   Arise...
.  .
   Shine...

[B2]
.  G   D/F#      C              G
   Wake up, wake up; light will shine.</lyrics>
