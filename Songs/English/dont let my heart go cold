<lyrics>[V1]
.D            A
 Don't let my love grow cold
.    Em           G               D
 I'm calling out, light the fire again
.D            A
 Don't let my vision die
.    Em           G               D  A  Em G
 I'm calling out, light the fire again__

[V2]
.D           A
 You know my heart, my deeds
.    Em           G                  D
 I'm calling out, light the fire again
.             A
 I need Your discipline
.    Em           G                  D
 I'm calling out, light the fire again

[C1]
.  Em               Bm                   A
   I am here to buy gold, refined in the fire
.   G               D                   A
   Naked and poor, wretched and blind I come
.                C  G
   Clothe me in white
.             A        G
   So I won't be ashamed
.                 D
   Lord light the fire again</lyrics>
