<lyrics>[V1]
 Open now thy gates of beauty, Zion, let me enter there, Where my soul in joyful duty Waits for Him Who answers prayer. Oh, how bless√®d is this place, Filled with solace, light and grace!

[V2]
 Lord, my God, I come before Thee, Come Thou also unto me; Where we find Thee and adore Thee, There a heav'n on earth must be. To my heart, oh, enter Thou, Let it be Thy temple now!

[V3]
 Here Thy praise is gladly chanted, Here Thy seed is duly sown; Let my soul, where it is planted, Bring forth precious sheaves alone, So that all I hear may be Fruitful unto life in me.

[V4]
 Thou my faith increase and quicken, Let me keep Thy gift divine, Howsoe'er temptations thicken; May Thy Word still o'er me shine As my guiding star through life, As my comfort in my strife.

[V5]
 Speak, O God, and I will hear Thee, Let Thy will be done indeed; May I undisturbed draw near Thee While Thou dost Thy people feed. Here of life the fountain flows, Here is balm for all our woes.</lyrics>
