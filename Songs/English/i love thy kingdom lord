 I love thy kingdom, Lord

[V2]
 I love thy kingdom, Lord, the house of thine abode,
 The church our blest Redeemer saved with his own precious blood.

[V3]
 I love thy church, O God! Her walls before thee stand
 Dear as the apple of thine eye, and graven on thy hand.

[V4]
 For her my tears shall fall, for her my prayers ascend,
 To her my cares and toils be given, till toils and cares shall end.

[V5]
 Beyond my highest joy i prize her heavenly ways,
 Her sweet communion, solemn vows, her hymns of love and praise.

[V6]
 Sure as thy truth shall last, to Zion shall be given
 The brightest glories earth can yield, and brighter bliss of heaven.</lyrics>
