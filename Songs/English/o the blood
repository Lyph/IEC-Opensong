<title>O the Blood</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 O the blood
 Crimson love
 Price of life's demand
 Shameful sin
 Placed on Him
 The hope of every man

[C1]
   CHORUS:
   O the blood of Jesus washes me
   O the blood of Jesus shed for me
   What a sacrifice that saved my life
   Yes, the blood it is my victory

[V2]
 Savior, Son
 Holy One
 Slain so I can live
 See the Lamb
 The great I AM
 Who takes away my sin

[C2]
   CHORUS:
   O the blood of Jesus washes me
   O the blood of Jesus shed for me
   What a sacrifice that saved my life
   Yes, the blood it is my victory

[V3]
 Oh the blood of the Lamb
 Oh the blood of the Lamb
 Oh the blood of the Lamb
 The precious blood of the Lamb
 What a sacrifice
 That saved my life
 Yes the blood it is my victory

[V4]
 O what love
 No greater love
 Grace how can it be
 That in my sin
 Yes even then
 He shed His blood for me

[C3]
   CHORUS:
   O the blood of Jesus washes me
   O the blood of Jesus shed for me
   What a sacrifice that saved my life
   Yes, the blood it is my victory

[V5]
 What a sacrifice that saved my life
 Yes, the blood it is my victory

[V6]
 What can wash away my sin?
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus
 What can make me whole again?
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus</lyrics>
