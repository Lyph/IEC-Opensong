.              B
 Even though I walk
 through the valley of the shadow of death,
.     E2/G#
 Your perfect love is casting out fear.
.                  B
 And even when I'm caught
 in the middle of the storms of this life,
.  E2/G#
 I won't turn back, I know You are near.

[P1]

[V2]
 And I can see a light that is coming
 For the heart that holds on,
 A glorious light beyond all compare.
 And there will be an end to these troubles,
 But until that day comes,
 We'll live to know You here on the earth.

[B1]

   Yes, I can see a light
   that is coming for the heart that holds on.

   And there will be an end to these troubles,
.                           F#sus
   But until that day comes,
   Still I will praise You!
.  E2                  B   F#susE2
   Still I will praise You!</lyrics>
