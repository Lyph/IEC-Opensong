<lyrics>[V1]
 I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
 Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
 Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
 Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know (ooh oh)

[C1]
   You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
   You say I am strong when I think I am weak
   You say I am held when I am falling short
   When I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
   And I believe, oh I believe what You say of me

[V2]
 The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
 In You I find my worth, in You I find my identity, (ooh oh)

[V3]
 Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
 You have every failure God, and You'll have every victory, (ooh oh)</lyrics>
