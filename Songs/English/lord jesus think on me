<lyrics>[V1]
 Lord Jesus, think on me And purge away my sin; From earthborn passions set me free And make me pure within.

[V2]
 Lord Jesus, think on me, With many'a care oppressed; Let me Thy loving servant be And taste Thy promised rest.

[V3]
 Lord Jesus, think on me Amid the battle's strife; In all my pain and misery Be Thou my Health and Life.

[V4]
 Lord Jesus, think on me Nor let me go astray; Through darkness and perplexity Point Thou the heav'nly way.

[V5]
 Lord Jesus, think on me When floods the tempest high; When on doth rush the enemy, O Savior, be Thou nigh!</lyrics>
