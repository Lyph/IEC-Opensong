<lyrics>[V1]
.E              B      A            E
 Emptied of His glory, God became a man
.   A                B            E
 To walk on earth in ridicule and shame;
.  A           B          C#m            F#
 A Ruler yet a Servant, a Shepherd yet a Lamb,
.  E               B          E
 A Man of sorrows, agony, and pain.

[V2]
.E             B       A            E
 Humbled and rejected, beaten and despised,
. A                 B              E
 Upon the cross the Son of God was slain;
.     A              B            C#m          F#
 Just like a lamb to slaughter: a sinless Sacrifice,
.    E                B               E
 But by His death His loss became our gain.

[C1]
.  E     F#m   B     E
   He is Lord, He is Lord!
.         E     E/D#     C#m            F#m  B
   He has risen from the dead and He is Lord!
.        E          E7         A         Am
   Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
.       E     B         E
   that Jesus Christ is Lord!

[V3]
.E              B        A             E
 Satan's forces crumbled like a mighty wall,
.    A                   B              E
 The stone that held Him in was rolled aside;
.    A                 B         C#m         F#
 The Prince of Life in glory was lifted over all,
.    E                B             E
 Now earth and heaven echo with the cry!

[C2]
.  E       F#m   B       E
   You are Lord, You are Lord!
.           E     E/D#     C#m              F#m  B
   You have risen from the dead and You are Lord!
.         E          E7          A         Am
   And my knee shall bow, and my tongue confess
.       E     B         E
   that Jesus Christ is Lord!</lyrics>
