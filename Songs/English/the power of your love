.G      D       Em
 Lord I come to You
.                Bm       Em
 Let my heart be changed, renewed
.        D        C               D        Em    C   D
 Flowing from the grace that I've found in You
.G             D       Em
 And Lord I've come to know
.                 Bm     Em
 The weaknesses I see in me
.        D        C    D
 Will be stripped away
.                     C     G   D   Em   G
 By the power of Your love

[C1]
.  C       D                    C        G   D   Em   G
   Hold me close, let Your love surround me
.  C        D                     C     G   Dm  G
   Bring me near, draw me to Your side
.      C    D                          C    G
   And as I wait I'll rise up like the eagle
.             D         Em               D        C
   And I will soar with You, Your Spirit leads me on

   By the power of Your love

[V2]
 Lord unveil my eyes
 Let me see You face to face
 The knowledge of Your love as You live in me
 Lord renew my mind
 As Your will unfolds in my life
 In living every day
 By the power of Your love</lyrics>
