<lyrics>[V1]
 Let us adore (Let us adore)
 The ever-living God (the ever-living God)
 And render praise (and render praise)
 unto Him (unto Him)

[V2]
 Who spread out the Heavens (Who spread out the
 Heavens)
 And established the Earth (and established the earth)
 And whose glory (and whose glory)
 Is revealed in the Heavens above (in the heavens above)
 And whose greatness (and whose Greatness)
 Is manifest throughout all the Earth

[V3]
 He is our God
 There is none else !

[V4]
 You are God
 there is none like You!</lyrics>
