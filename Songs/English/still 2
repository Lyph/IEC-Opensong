<lyrics>[V1]
 Hide me now
 Under Your wings
 Cover me
 Within Your mighty hand

[C1]
   When the oceans rise
   And thunders roar
   I will soar with You
   Above the storm
   Father You are King
   Over the flood
   I will be still and know
   You are God

[V2]
 Find rest my soul
 In Christ alone
 Know His power
 In quietness and trust</lyrics>
