 He brought me to his banqueting table (Women echo)
 He brought me to his banqueting table (Women echo)
 And his banner over me is love

[V2]
 I am my beloved's and He is mine (Women echo)
 I am my beloved's and He is mine (Women echo)
 And His banner over me is love
 Yes His banner over me is love

[V3]
 We can feel the love of God in this place
 We believe your goodness
 We receive your grace
 We delight ourselves at your table oh God
 You do all things well, just look at our lives

[V4]
 And His banner over me is love
 Yes His banner over me is love

[V5]
 His banner over you, his banner over me
 His banner over us, it is love, love, love</lyrics>
