.A
 With all I'm holding inside
.A                        D
 With all my hopes and desires
.D
 And all the dreams that I've dreamt
.A
 With all I'm hoping to be
.A
 And all that the world will bring
.D                            C#
 And all that fails to compare

[P1]
.  A       B               C#
   You say You want all of me
.  A
   I wouldnt have it any other way

[C1]
.  A
   I've got a Saviour and He's living in me
.  D
   WHOA!
.  F#
   I wana know
.  B      D
   I wana know You today
.  A
   And You're the best thing that has happened to me
.  D                        F#
   And the world will never take
.  B                    D
   The world will never take You away

[C2]
.  A      D                     A
   No-one could ever take You away</lyrics>
