 O that the Lord would guide my ways To keep His statutes still! O that my God would grant me grace To know and do His will!

[V2]
 O send Thy Spirit down to write Thy law upon my heart! Nor let my tongue indulge deceit, Nor act the liar's part.

[V3]
 From vanity turn off mine eyes; Let no corrupt design, Nor covetous desires arise Within this soul of mine.

[V4]
 Order my footsteps by Thy Word, And make my heart sincere; Let sin have no dominion, Lord, But keep my conscience clear.

[V5]
 Assist my soul, too apt to stray, A stricter watch to keep; And should I e'er forget Thy way, Restore Thy wand'ring sheep.

[V6]
 Make me to walk in Thy commands, 'Tis a delightful road;
 Nor let my head, or heart, or hands, Offend against my God.</lyrics>
