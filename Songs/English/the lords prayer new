 Father in heaven, Your name we confess, High and exalted in bright holiness; O may Your kingdom come, Your will be done, And may the earth and heav'n be joined as one.

[V2]
 O Father, now our daily bread supply, And grant forgiveness for iniquity; May we forgive as we have been forgiv'n, Our hearts with mercy filled, as Yours in heav'n.

[V3]
 O Father, lead us from temptation's pow'r; May we find safety from sin's trying hour; I Lord, deliver from the evil one, All this we ask through Your beloved Son.</lyrics>
