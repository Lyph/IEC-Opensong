<lyrics>[V1]
.D                  F#/A2
 I've been so busy, I missed the reasons
.Bm                  Em
 I missed your love, I nearly missed it all
.D                        F#/A2
 Still you've loved me, And you've healed me
.Bm                        Em
 You've given all and it brought me to your cross

[P1]
.         A2    Bm    G
   I stand only because
.        A2    Bm    G
   You've given me grace to walk
.        A2    BmG
   Only because

[C1]
.                 D A2BmG
   You've carried me
.              A2
   You carried me
.              Bm            G
   You carried me through it all
.          D
   And I believe
.           A2
   Yes, I believe
.               Bm
   You'll carry me
.              G
   All the way home
.  D    F#/A   B   Em
   Mercy covers all

[V2]
 I know the scripture
 I've known the songs
 I sang the words
 From my hollowed Heart
 You've spoken softly
 Through the storm
 I've heard your voice
 And felt the calm

[P2]
   I stand only because
   You've given me faith to walk

[B1]
.  A2                 Bm
   I know that you love me
.  F#                    G
   I'll never doubt it I can't live without it
   Your mercy has found me
   I'll never doubt it I can't live without it</lyrics>
