<lyrics>[V1]
 Comes any good from Nazareth? The scornful challenge as of old Is flung on many'a jeering breath From cloistered cells and marts of gold.

[V2]
 Comes any good from Nazareth? Behold, the mighty Nazarene, The Lord of life, the Lord of death, Through warring ages walks serene.

[V3]
 One touch upon His garment's fringe Still heals the hurt of bitter years. Before Him yet the demons cringe, He gives the wine of joy for tears.

[V4]
 O city of the Carpenter, Upon the hill slope old and gray, The world among its pain and stir Turns yearning eyes on thee today.

[V5]
 For He who dwelt in Nazareth, And wrought with toil of hand and brain, Alone gives victory to faith Until the day He come again.</lyrics>
