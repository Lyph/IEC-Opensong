<lyrics>[V1]
 Father God,
 All I ever needed was in your plan,
 All I ever wanted was in your hands,
 Now I don't have to wander so far,
 Just to find a well,
 for water that does not quench the thirst.

[V2]
 Little birds,
 Keep your feathered wings wrapped around your face,
 The perfect little coat for a warm embrace,
 And spread your wings in flight,
 Overhead in the open sky,
 The perfect picture, black and white.

[V3]
 They don't toil and spin,
 They don't reap and sow,
 They don't store in barns but still the flowers grow,
 I put my trust in You,
 See all the birds You feed,
 My daily bread, my life, for You have all I need.</lyrics>
