<lyrics>[V1]
 There are many prodigal songs
 On our city streets they run, searching for shelter
 There are homes broken down
 People's hopes have fallen to the ground from failures

[V2]
 This is an emergency

[C1]
   There are tears from the saints
   For the lost and unsaved
   We're crying for them come back home
   We're crying for them come back home
   And all Your children will stretch out their hands
   And pick up the crippled man
   Father, we will lead them home
   Father, we will lead them home

[V3]
 There are schools full of hatred
 Even churches have forsaken love and mercy
 May we see this generation
 In this state of desperation for Your glory

[B1]
   Sinner, reach out your hands
   Children, in Christ you stand
   Sinner, reach out your hands
   Children, in Christ you stand

[C2]
   And all Your children will stretch out their hands
   And pick up the crippled man
   Father, we will lead them home
   Father, we will lead them home</lyrics>
