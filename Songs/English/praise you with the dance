<lyrics>[V1]
.       D           A
 I will sing to the Lord,
.    Bm             G
 And I will lift my voice
.    D2       Asus     Bm
 For You have heard my cry.
.G
  
.       D           A
 I will sing to the Lord,
.    Bm             G
 And I will lift my hands
.    D2       Asus       Bm         G
 For You have brought me out of the pit,
.    D2       Asus       G   A      D
 For You have brought me out of the pit.
