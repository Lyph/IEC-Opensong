<lyrics>[C1]
   God is good
   We sing and shout it
   God is good
   We celebrate
   God is good
   No more we doubt it
   God is good
   We know it's true

[V1]
 And when I think of His love for me
 My heart fills with praise
 And I feel like dancing
 For in His house there is room for me
 And I run with arms opened wide</lyrics>
