<lyrics>[V1]
 Come, Holy Spirit, Lord our God, And pour Thy gifts of grace abroad; Thy faithful people fill with blessing, Love's fire their hearts possessing. O Lord, Thou by Thy heav'nly Light Dost gather and in faith unite Through all the world a holy nation To sing to Thee with exultation, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

[V2]
 O, holiest Light! O Rock adored! Give us Thy light, Thy living Word, To God Himself our spirits leading, With Him as children pleading. From error, Lord, our souls defend, That they on Christ alone attend; In Him with faith unfeigned abiding, In Him with all their might confiding. Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

[V3]
 O holiest Fire! O Source of rest! Grant that with joy and hope possest, And in Thy service kept forever, Naught us from Thee may sever. Lord, may Thy pow'r prepare each heart; To our weak nature strength impart, Onward to press, our foes defying, To Thee, through living and through dying. Hallelujah! Hallelujah!</lyrics>
