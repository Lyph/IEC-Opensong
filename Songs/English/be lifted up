<lyrics>[V1]
 Be lifted up, be lifted up
 As we bow down, be lifted up

[V2]
 Let the heavens rejoice, Let the nations be glad
 Let the whole earth tremble
 For you are God
 Come and worship the Lord
 In the beauty of holiness
 As we bow down, be lifted up
 As we bow down, be lifted up</lyrics>
