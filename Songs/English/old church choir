<lyrics>[V1]
 There's revival and it's spreading
 Like a wildfire in my heart
 A Sunday morning hallelujah
 And it's lasting all week long

[V2]
 Can you hear it? Can you feel it?
 It's the rhythm of a gospel song
 Once you choose it, you can't lose it
 There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy

[C1]
   I've got an old church choir singing in my soul
   I've got a sweet salvation and it's beautiful
   I've got a heart overflowing cause I've been restored
   No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy
   No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy

[V3]
 When the valleys that I wander
 Turn to mountains that I can't climb
 You are with me, you never leave me
 There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy

[C2]
   I've got an old church choir singing in my soul
   I've got a sweet salvation and it's beautiful
   I've got a heart overflowing cause I've been restored
   No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy
   No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy

[B1]
   Clap your hands and stomp your feet
   Till you find that gospel beat
   Cause He's all you'll ever need
   He's all you'll ever need

[C3]
   I've got an old church choir singing in my soul
   I've got a sweet salvation and it's beautiful
   I've got a heart overflowing cause I've been restored
   No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy
   No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy
   No there ain't nothing gonna steal my joy</lyrics>
