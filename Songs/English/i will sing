<lyrics>[V1]
 I need to see You here, I need to know You're in control
 Though my heart is torn wide open I will trust, I will remember

[V2]
 I need to hear Your voice speaking to silence all my doubts
 Your word won't return empty, You will break through ev'ry darkness

[P1]
   Even when my breath is weak
   I will sing, I will sing
   Even in my suffering
   I will sing, I will sing

[V3]
 I need to see Your hope rising above my greatest fears
 Even death has been defeated, I will trust, I will remember

[P2]
   Even when the shadows fall
   I will sing, I will sing
   Even when the night is long
   I will sing, I will sing

[C1]
   Hallelujah, I surrender all to You
   Hallelujah, You are God You won't be shaken
   Hallelujah, I surrender all to You
   Hallelujah, You are God You won't be shaken

[V4]
 I need to see You here, I need to know You're in control
 Though my heart is torn wide open I will trust, I will rememberï»¿</lyrics>
