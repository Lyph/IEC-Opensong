<title>I will sing</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Lord You seem so far away
 A million miles or more it feels today
 And though I haven't lost my faith,
 I must confess right now
 that it's hard for me to pray
 But I dont know what to say
 and I dont know where to start
 But as You give the grace
 with all that's in my heart

[C1]
   I will sing
   I will praise
   even in my darkest time
   through the sorrow and the pain
   I will sing
   I will praise
   Lift my hands to honor You
   because Your word is true
   I will sing

[V2]
 Lord it's hard for me to see
 all the thoughts and plans You have for me
 But I will put my trust in You,
 Knowing that You died to set me free
 But I dont know what to say
 and I dont know where to start
 But as You give the grace
 with all that's in my heart</lyrics>
