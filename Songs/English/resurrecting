 Now at His feet we bow

 Now robed in majesty

 The radiance of perfect love

 The tomb where Life itself was laid
.               F#       C#
 Was borrowed for three days

 His body there would not remain

 Our God has robbed the grave
.             F#          C#
 Our God has robbed the grave</lyrics>
