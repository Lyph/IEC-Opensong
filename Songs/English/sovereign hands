<lyrics>[V1]
.E                 G#m
 I feel the push and I feel the pull
.           A
 Such a heavy weight, such a heavy weight
.                 E                        G#m
 The waves they do rise, then they do fall
.        A
 Such a heavy weight, such a heavy weight

[V2]
.          F#m          A            E
 But it's not on my shoulders anymore
 I've been bought by your blood Lord , I am yours
.    G#m          A
 No longer a slave to sin
 I am safe in your sovereign hands

[V3]
 I can rejoice even through pain
 You have shown me grace, You have shown me grace
 My heart it deceives, but I've been made new
 You have shown me grace, You have shown me grace

[V4]
 It's all on your shoulders forevermore
 I've been bought by your blood Lord
 I am yours
 No longer a slave to sin
 I am safe in your sovereign hands

[V5]
.E      G#m     A
 I'm safe in your hands</lyrics>
