<lyrics>[V1]
 Let Your living water flow over my soul
 Let Your Holy Spirit come and take control
 Of every situation that has troubled my mind
 All my cares and burdens on to You I roll

[C1]
   Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
   Father, Father, Father
   Spirit, Spirit, Spirit

[V2]
 Come now, Holy Spirit, and take control
 Hold me in Your loving arms and make me whole
 Wipe away all doubt and fear and take my pride
 Draw me to Your love and keep me by Your side

[V3]
 Give your life to Jesus, let Him fill your soul
 Let Him take you in His arms and make you whole
 As you give your life to Him He'll set you free
 You will live and reign with Him eternally</lyrics>
