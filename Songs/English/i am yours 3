 Singing of a love now,
 You taught this broken heart to sing again.
 Every day I'll come, to thank You, oh, to thank You.
 Singing of a life now,
 You taught this wounded soul to live again.
 Every day I'll live to thank You. oh, to thank You, today and every day.

   There's so much more that I need to give

   To thank You, to thank You. x2
.  Bb        F/A   Csus4 C     F
