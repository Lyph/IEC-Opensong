 Before You I will bow down in silence,
 Because there is no other God in the Universe,
 // Who could forgive me everything, could say to my soul:
 «Come to Me, and be blessed!» //

[V2]
 I'm running away from evil and vanity,
 And I believe that You will accept my heart.
 // Lord, please, put me in Your embrace,
 Let the soul warm up from the cold. //

[V3]
 I bear to you the sorrow of my soul,
 And You give me inspiration in return.
 // There is no place on earth where I am closer to You,
 Than on my knees in sincere humility. //</lyrics>
