 [Verse 1:]
 The day You came and found me I was lost inside.
 You called me from my darkness into Your light.
 I thought the times I trusted was all the time I wasted, but Jesus You're so faithful and now I can say:

[C1]
   [Chorus:]
   That all I am is Yours!
   All I am is Yours!

[V2]
 [Verse 2:]
 I can hear You clearly.
 Now I understand. I heard You call my name and I know it's for real.
 You took the pain inside me for all the light inside You.
