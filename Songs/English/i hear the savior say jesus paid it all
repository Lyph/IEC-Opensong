.G5                          D4                 G5
 I hear the Savior say, &quot;Thy strength indeed is small;
.         Em7                 C2            G5       D4     G5
 Child of weakness, watch and pray, find in Me thine all in all.&quot;

[C1]
.   G5            Em7  G5           D4
    Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe;
.  G5                 C2            G         D4       G
   Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.

[V2]
. G5                          D4              G5
  Lord, now indeed I find Thy power and Thine alone,
.    Em7                C2        G5       D4       G5
 Can change the leper's spots and melt the heart of stone.

[V3]
. G5                           D4              G5
  And when before the throne I stand in Him complete,
.       Em7             C2
 &quot;Jesus died my soul to save,&quot;
.   G5         D4      G5
 my lips shall still repeat.

[B1]
.      G5             G/B C2
    Oh praise the One who paid my debt,
.  G/B Am7(add4)        G/B C2
   And raised this life up  from the dead!

[B2]
.      G         D4       G
    He washed it white as snow.</lyrics>
