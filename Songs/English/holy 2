<lyrics>[V1]
 Just one look on Your face
 Just one glance of Your eyes
 My whole world is changed
 my whole world is changed

[V2]
 Oh I seek only to see Your face
 I don't wanna go anywhere without You God
 Without Your presence
 Oh let me see Your face
 The beauty of Your holiness God
 Take me into the holy place

[V3]
 And only one word comes to mind
 There's only one word to describe

[V4]
 Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty

[V5]
 There is no one like You
 You are Holy
