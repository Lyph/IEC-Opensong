.G                                 C                 G                  Am   D7
 God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus, He came to love, heal, and forgive;
.             G              C
 He lived and died to buy my pardon;
.         G                 D7              G
 An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.

[C1]
.             G                   C
   Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
.             G                  D7
   Because He lives, all fear is gone;
.            G D7  G7            C
   Because I know__ He holds the future,
.              G                D7              G
   And life is worth the living just because He lives.

[V2]
.G                           C                 G                Am    D7
 How sweet to hold a newborn baby and feel the pride and joy he gives;
.            G                C
 But greater still the calm assurance
.               G              D7              G
 This child can face uncertain days because He lives.

[V3]
.G                                C                        G              Am   D7
 And then one day I'll cross that river; I'll fight life's final war with pain;
.            G                  C
 And then as death gives way to vict'ry,
.             G               D7               G
 I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives.</lyrics>
