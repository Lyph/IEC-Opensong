<lyrics>[V1]
 O day of rest and gladness, o day of joy and light, O balm of care and sadness, most beautiful, most bright: On thee, the high and lowly, through ages joined in tune, Sing holy, holy, holy, to the great God Triune.

[V2]
 On thee, at the creation, the light first had its birth; On thee, for our salvation, Christ rose from depths of earth; On thee, our Lord, victorious, the Spirit sent from heaven, And thus on thee, most glorious, a triple light was given.

[V3]
 Thou art a port, protected from storms that round us rise; A garden, intersected with streams of paradise; Thou art a cooling fountain in life's dry, dreary sand; From thee, like Pisgah's mountain, we view our promised land.

[V4]
 Thou art a holy ladder, where angels go and come; Each Sunday finds us gladder, nearer to heaven, our home; A day of sweet refection, thou art a day of love, A day of resurrection from earth to things above.

[V5]
 Today on weary nations the heavenly manna falls; To holy convocations the silver trumpet calls, Where Gospel light is glowing with pure and radiant beams, And living water flowing, with soul refreshing streams.

[V6]
 New graces ever gaining from this our day of rest,
 We reach the rest remaining to spirits of the blessed.
 To Holy Ghost be praises, to Father, and to Son;
 The church her voice upraises to Thee, blessed Three in One.</lyrics>
