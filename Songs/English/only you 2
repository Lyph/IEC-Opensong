<lyrics>[V1]
.C       G/B             Am
 Take my heart, I lay it down
.       F                 C
 At the feet of You who's crowned.
.            G/B               Am
 And take my life, I'm letting go;
.          F               C
 I lift it up to You who's throned.

[C1]
.  C        G/B     Am
   And I will worship You, Lord,
.  F
   Only You, Lord.
.  C        G/B       Am
   And I will bow down before You,
.  F
   Only You, Lord.

[V2]
.C       G/B           Am
 Take my fret. Take my fear.
.      F                C
 All I have I'm leaving here.
.          G/B              Am
 Be all my hopes, be all my dreams,
.              F                C
 Be all my delights, be my everything.

[B1]
.  C                    G/B          Am
   And it's just You and me here now.
.               F
   Only You and me here now. (4X)
.  C                      G/B
   You should see the view
.  Am        F
   When it's only You.</lyrics>
