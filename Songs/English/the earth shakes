<title>The earth shakes</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 The Earth shakes at the sound of His voice
 The nations tremble before Him
 The idols of men are all falling
 At the feet of the LORD our God
 At the feet of the LORD our God

[V2]
 The Lord is warrior; fearless is He
 The Lord is mighty in battle
 His armies outnumber His enemies
 When they shout the strongholds of Satan come crashing down!
 And Babylon is falling, falling down!

[V3]
 The Lord is a Saviour; gracious is He
 The Lord is full of compassion
 His army is also His family
 When they shout the strongholds of Satan come crashing down!
 And Babylon is falling, falling down!

[V4]
 The Lord has a kingdom; Jesus is King
 He reigns forever and ever!
 He's given us power and authority
 When we shout the strongholds of Satan come crashing down!
 And Babylon is falling, falling down!</lyrics>
