.Emaj7
 What does it mean to be saved?
.         Dmaj7
 Isn't it more than just a prayer to pray,
.A/C#            Dmaj7      Emaj7
 More than just a way to Hea-ven?

[P1]
.  Emaj7
   What does it mean to be His?
.        Dmaj7
   To be formed in His Likeness,
.                      A
   Know that we have a purpose:
.        C#m
   To be salt and light in the world, in the world,
.        D
   To be salt and light in the world!

[C1]
.            E
   Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,
.            Bm7
   Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,
.            A                     Dmaj7        E
   Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, say so, say so! (2X)

[V2]
.Emaj7                                 Dmaj7
 Oh that the church would arise Oh that we would see with Jesus' eyes
.A/C#              Dmaj7    Emaj7
 We could show the world heaven

[P2]
.  Emaj7                                Dmaj7
   Show what it means to be His: To be formed in His Likeness
.                        A
   Show them they have a purpose:
.        C#m                                              D
   To be salt and light in the world, in the world, to be salt and light in the world!
.        F#m7                                             D
   To be salt and light in the world, in the world, to be salt and light in the world!

.  A/C#           D             E
   I am redeemed, I am redeemed (2X)</lyrics>
