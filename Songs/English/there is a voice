 There is a voice that must be heard,
 There is a song that must be sung;
 There is a name that must be lifted high.
 There is a treasure more than gold,
 There is a King upon the throne;
 There is one whose praise will fill the skies.

[V2]
 His name is Jesus, friend of sinners,
 Jesus, Jesus, friend of mine.

[V3]
 There is a peace that calms our fears,
 There is a love stronger than death;
 There is a hope that goes beyond the grave.
 There is a Friend who won't let go,
 There is a heart that beats for You;
 There is one name by which we are saved.

[V4]
 When I was captive to my fears,
 You were the one who came to me,
 You set me free.</lyrics>
