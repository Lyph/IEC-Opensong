<lyrics>[V1]
 VERSE 1
.    Hm                     G               D
 There is no one like our God in all the earth
.    Hm                G             D
 He alone be lifted high above all else
.            Hm               G                D
 What could ever stand against His matchless love
.        H6m           G          D
 By the power of His name we overcome

[V2]

 VERSE 2
.       Hm               G               D
 Every doubt and every fear before Him bow
.          Hm             G                  D
 For the Savior of the world is here right now
.        Hm             G               D
 He has broken every chain and we are free
.          Hm                G                   D
 He laid death inside the grave He holds the victory

 You hold all authority

 Sin and sickness bow their knee

.Hm
 Name above all other names
