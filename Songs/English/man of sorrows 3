.A               F#m    C#    D       A      E/B  B   E
 Man of Sorrows, what a name! For the Son of God, Who came
.A              D/A  A             E    F#m    D  A
 Ruined sinners to reclaim. Hallelujah! What a Savior!

[V2]
.A                 F#m      C#    D     A        E/B  B   E
 Bearing shame and scoffing rude, In my place condemned He stood;
.A                D/A      A             E    F#m    D  A
 Sealed my pardon with His blood. Hallelujah! What a Savior!

[V3]
.A                 F#m      C#  D        A       E/B  B   E
 Guilty, vile, and helpless we; Spotless Lamb of God was He;
.A               D/A    A          E    F#m    D  A
 Full atonement! Can it be? Hallelujah! What a Savior!

[V4]
.A             F#m   C#   D      A          E/B  B   E
 Lifted up was He to die; &quot;It is finished!&quot; was His cry;
.A               D/A   A            E    F#m    D  A
 Now in heaven exalted high. Hallelujah! What a Savior!

[V5]
.A                  F#m      C#    D       A        E/B  B   E
 When He comes, our glorious King, All His ransomed home to bring,
.A             D/A        A            E    F#m    D  A
 Then anew His song we'll sing: Hallelujah! What a Savior!</lyrics>
