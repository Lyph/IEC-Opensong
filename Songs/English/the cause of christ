<lyrics>[V1]
 The only thing I want in life
 Is to be known for loving Christ
 To build His church, to love His bride
 And make His name known far and wide

[C1]
   For this cause I live, for this cause I'd die
   I surrender all, for the cause of Christ
   All I once held dear, I will leave behind
   For my joy is this, oh the cause of Christ

[V2]
 He is all my soul will prize
 Regardless of the joy or trial
 When agonizing questions rise
 In Jesus all my hope abides

[C2]
   For this cause I live, for this cause I'd die
   I surrender all, for the cause of Christ
   All I once held dear, I will leave behind
   For my joy is this, oh the cause of Christ

[B1]
   Jesus my Jesus
   For Your glory for Your name
   Jesus my Jesus
   I will only sing Your praise

[C3]
   For this cause I live, for this cause I'd die
   I surrender all, for the cause of Christ
   All I once held dear, I will leave behind
   For my joy is this, oh the cause of Christ

[V3]
 It is not fame that I desire
 Nor stature in my brother's eye
 I pray it's said about my life
 That I lived more to build Your name than mine</lyrics>
