<lyrics>[V1]
 Let the new song arise
 From every tongue and tribe
 Every mountain high
 And every valley

[V2]
 Let our love burn bright
 All through the darkest night
 Let the flames take flight

[V3]
 To the one who gave it all to have my heart
 And from the very start, He knew every part of me
 Who I would be, and how He'd make me to give Him glory

[V4]
 Beautiful one, You saved my soul
 You are my everything, You make me whole
 What can I give but give my all?
 You're so deserving

[V5]
 So I will love You Lord
 With all my heart and soul
 All my mind and strength
 Just like You told us to and

[V6]
 You are here
 Your spirit lives in me
 You've opened my eyes to see

[V7]
 You are no more behind a temple wall, You gave Your life for all
 Waiting for an open heart to open wide, and You'd come inside
 And breathe new life</lyrics>
