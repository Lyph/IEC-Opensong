<lyrics>[V1]
 VERSE 1:
 You have come
 And we have found life
 Everlasting
 Now alive
 To know Your freedom
 Never ending

[C1]
   PRE CHORUS:
   You alone have made a way for us
   In Your love
   You are life

[C2]
   CHORUS:
   I'm living in the light of my Saviour
   Dancing in the arms of forever
   I'm singing like I'm walking on water
   You are life
   Alive in me

[V2]
 VERSE 2:
 From greyest skies
 To living colour
 You have called us
 In Your life
 Your light uncovered
 The world to see now

[C3]
   POST - CHORUS:
   I give my life to follow
   'Cause Your love is all I want now
   You are life
   You are life
   Alive in me

[B1]
   BRIDGE:
   For all the world to find Your love
   For all the world to see that You are God
   Forever be lifted high

[V3]
 The One who holds the universe
 And every beating heart across the earth
 Jesus be lifted high

[V4]
