 The stars in their courses above
 Shine for Your glory; You alone are God
 By You every mountain was formed
 To tell of the story; You alone are God
 Eternally worthy of praise
 We join with creation and sing

[V2]
 Lord, for all that You are
 For all that You've done
 I will praise You
 Lord, for all that You are
 For all that You'll do
 I will praise You

[V3]
 The roar of Your thunder and rain
 Tell of Your power; You alone are God
 The people You've called and redeemed
 Bow in surrender; You alone are God
 Eternally worthy of praise
 We join with creation and sing

[V4]
 Never ending, unfailing
 Everlasting, unfading
 You are</lyrics>
