 Renew us in this day
 Just like You said You would
 Your Word is not in vain
 Our hearts reaching heavenward

[P1]
   Fresh outpouring tear the fabric open
   Come, Jesus come
   Breath of heaven nothing left unshaken
   We long for more

[C1]
   We need a fresh outpouring
   Unleash a fresh outpouring
   We need a fresh outpouring
   Unleash a fresh outpouring

[V2]
 As temporary fades
 Let glory invade this earth
 Your power on display
 Our eyes looking heavenward

[B1]
   There is fire, stirring in our bones
   A shout is rising, rising up inside
   Soak the earth, come and fill our hearts
   Your voice is calling, calling us to life!</lyrics>
