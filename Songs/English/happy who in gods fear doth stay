<lyrics>[V1]
 Happy the man who feareth God, Whose feet His holy ways have trod; Thine own good hand shall nourish thee, And well and happy shalt thou be.

[V2]
 Thy wife shall, like a fruitful vine, Fill all thy house with clusters fine; Thy children all be fresh and sound, Like olive\plants thy table round.

[V3]
 Lo! to the man these blessings cleave Who in God's holy fear doth live; From him the ancient curse hath fled By Adam's race inherited.

[V4]
 Out of Mount Zion God shall send, And crown with joy thy latter end; That thou Jerusalem mayst see, In favor and prosperity.

[V5]
 He shall be with thee in thy ways, And give thee health and length of days Yea, thou shalt children's children see, And peace on Israel shall be.</lyrics>
