.C         G2/B   F/A          G/B
 Blessing, honor, glory to the Lamb;

 Holy, righteous, worthy is the Lamb. (2x)

[V2]
.C/E             Am7      G
 Death could not hold Him down,
.    Em7 C/E F Am7 Gsus
 For He  is  risen,

 Seated upon the throne!
.   Em7 C/E F    Dm7 Gsus C
 He is  the Lamb of  God.</lyrics>
