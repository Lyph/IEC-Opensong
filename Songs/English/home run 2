.G                 D
 The lights go on, another game day.
.  Em                        C
 I grabbed my bat and headed for the plate.
.        G                 D               Em
 But the first pitch was a curve and I was done - strike one.
.          G                         D
 I stepped outta the box, looked the pitcher in the eye.
.          Em                  C
 You could read his lips, &quot;Hey punk, you're mine.&quot;
.     G                          D                      Em               (EmDEm)
 So I gave him a wink and said, &quot;Let's see what you can do&quot; - strike two.

.                C          Em          D                     G
   Gotta keep my eye on the ball, swing straight and true and follow through,
.  C        Em                  D    (D
   Don't be afraid whatever the call,
.  DD/GD)
    
.                C     Em
   Because we're never alone,
.      D                 G
   Our Coach is there to cheer us on.
.                F#   G        F#         G
   Well it's the wind up, here comes that ball.
.            Em                                  C     D
   You gotta pray and swing, watch it 'till it's goin' goin' it's gone.

.  G  D Em C G D  Em
   Home home home run.
.             Em   D
   (We need a home run)
.  G  D Em C G D  Em
   Home home home run.
.             Em   D
   (We need a home run)

.         G                  D
 You know life can be like a baseball game;
.Em                         C
 We're on the same team but we're not all the same.
.       G                D             Em       (Em
 That's why we've got to learn to play together.
.DEmEmD)
  
.         G                 D
 I didn't join this team to sit on the bench.
.Em              C
 I'm goin' deep, swingin' for the fence.
.G                     D                Em   (EmDEmEmD)
 I got some friends on base I gotta get home.

[B1]
.  Em                                        C
   We are not the first to play this game or stand over this plate.
.  Em                               C
   We are surrounded by the legacy, like they're sittin' in the stands.
.  C                                           Em  C  Em  G   D
   I can see them wavin' their hands, sayin', &quot;Go ,go all the way!&quot;
