[V2]
 CHORUS
 Your life
 Your life
 Your life
 In mine

[V3]
 VERSE: 1
 Your thoughts
 Your ways
 Your mystery
 Too deep for words
 My spirit burns to worship You

[V4]
 VERSE: 2
 Your heart
 Your plans
 Your will for me
 There's nothing else my soul desires
 Than more of You

[B1]
   BRIDGE:
   Take my heart
   Take my soul
   Take my mind and I will
   Give my thoughts
   Give my all
   Give my life to follow You
   Take my hands
   Take my breath
   Take my dreams and I will
   Lift my eyes
   Lift my faith
   Lift my voice and worship You

[V5]
 VERSE: 3
 My God
 My closest friend
 I need Your love
 More than my lungs
 Need oxygen</lyrics>
