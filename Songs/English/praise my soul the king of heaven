<lyrics>[V1]
 Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;
 To his feet your tribute bring;
 Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
 Evermore His praises sing;
 Alleluia, alleluia!
 Praise the everlasting King.

[V2]
 Praise Him for His grace and favor
 To His people in distress;
 Praise Him still the same as ever,
 Slow to chide, and swift to bless:
 Alleluia, alleluia!
 Glorious in His faithfulness.

[V3]
 Father like He tends and spares us;
 Well our feeble frame He knows;
 In His hand He gently bears us,
 Rescues us from all our foes.
 Alleluia, alleluia!
 Widely yet His mercy flows.

[V4]
 Angels, help us to adore Him;
 You behold Him face to face;
 Sun and moon, bow down before Him,
 All who dwell in time and space.
 Alleluia, alleluia!
 Praise with us the God of grace.</lyrics>
