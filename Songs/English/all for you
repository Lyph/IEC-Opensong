<lyrics>[V1]
 Nothing compares to
 Life I have in You;
 Nothing of this world satisfies.
 So I want to let go,
 I want to let You know
 All that I have to give is Yours.

[P1]
   Here I am, as gold to the fire
   I will surrender to Your hand.
   To this place,
   Lord, I have come
   Ready for Your touch.

[C1]
   It's all for You.
   It's all for You.
   I'm letting go.
   I'm letting go.

[V2]
 What is it in me
 That hangs on for so long?
 Why do I fight the tears that come?
 I work so hard to
 Keep in control when
 All that I want is to let go.

[C2]
   I'll take this life
   And lay it down;
   I'm letting go.
   I'm letting go.
   My hopes and dreams,
   Here at Your feet;
   I'm letting go.
   I'm letting go.

[B1]
   And I am ready for Your life.
   And I am ready for You now.</lyrics>
