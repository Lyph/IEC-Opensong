 The world's getting darker by the day
 I'm on my knees but don't know what to pray
 The broken things that broken people do
 But knowing just how far You came for me
 Gives me hope for every soul I'll meet
 There's no one so far gone that You can't reach
 So reach through me
 Let them see, Lord, let them see

[C1]
   Your love is the bridge You built with the cross
   And Your truth is the light that searches for the lost
   Your grace won't stop reaching, Your mercy won't let go
   'Cause Your love is the bridge and Your truth leads us-
   Home, home
   You lead us
   Home, home

[V2]
 You never told the broken they were whole
 You spoke the truth that healed their broken souls
 You'd never leave us here to fight alone
 With love we earn the right to speak Your truth
 It's not just what we say it's what we do
 I wanna be a bridge that leads to You
 So reach through me
 Let them see, Lord, let them see

[B1]
   No rescue so relentless
   No greater love than this
   Where sin leaves a canyon
   Your love builds a bridge
   No rescue so relentless
   No greater love than this
   Where sin leaves a canyon
   Your love builds a bridge
   No rescue so relentless
   No greater love than this
   Where sin leaves a canyon
   Your love builds a bridge
   Your love builds a bridge

[C2]
   Your love is the bridge You built with the cross
   And Your truth is the light that searches for the lost
   Your grace won't stop reaching, Your mercy won't let go
   'Cause Your love is the bridge, 'cause Your love is the bridge

[V3]
 No rescue so relentless
 No greater love than this
 Where sin leaves a canyon
 Your love builds a bridge</lyrics>
