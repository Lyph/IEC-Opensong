.C
 I can't do anything, I can't do anything without You.
.G7
 But You can do anything, You can do anything You want.
.C
 And I just can't belive, I can't belive that You would love me,
.G7
 After everything, after everything I've done.

[C1]
.                Dm                 C
   And I want to love You, love You more than life itself
.                F              C
   And I want to hold You, even though You can't be held,
.                 Am                     D7
   Because You're so much more than everything I've ever known,
.     Fm        C
   Anything, anything.

[V2]
.C
 I'd give anything, I would give anything to hold You.
.G7
 I want to live for You, for You alone I want to live.
.C
 When I see Your face, I would do anything to know You.
.G7
 You gave everything, You gave everything to give.

[B1]
.     C
   Halle, Hallelujah,
.     F
   Halle, Hallelujah,
.     Dm       Dm7
   Halle, Hallelujah,
.     C
   Halle</lyrics>
