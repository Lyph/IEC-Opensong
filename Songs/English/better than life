.A                      E
 Better than the riches of this world
.F#m                      D
 Better than the sound of my friend's voices
.A                       E
 Better than the biggest dreams of my heart
.F#m                 D
 And that's just the start
.A                          Bm7
 Better than getting what I say I need
.F#m                    D
 Better than living the life that I want to
.A                           E
 Better than the love anyone could give
.F#m7      D
 Your love is

[P1]
.      A       Bm7         A/C#
   You hold me now in Your arms
.      D            E F#mD
   And never let me go

[C1]
.  A                    E
   You oh Lord make the sun shine
.               F#m7               D
   And the moon light in the night sky
.      A                  E
   You give me breath and all Your love
.    F#m                    D
   I give my heart to You because

[B1]
.  A               E
   ***I can't stop falling in love with You
.  F#m                D                    A
   ***I'll never stop falling in love with You</lyrics>
