<lyrics>[V1]
 Oh Lord our Lord, You're wonderful
 Lord there is none, Lord there is none like You
 Oh Lord our Lord, so powerful
 Lord there is none, Lord there is none like You

[C1]
   // How majestic is Your Name  //
   In all the Earth

[V2]
 Oh Lord our Lord, You're merciful
 Lord there is none, Lord there is none like You
 Oh Lord our Lord, You're faithful
 Lord there is none, Lord there is none like You

[B1]
   Jesus, Jesus God our saviour,
   Jesus, Jesus God our maker
   Jesus, Jesus Name above all names</lyrics>
