.C               Dm
 Find me with open arms

 Pull me towards Your heart
.                F
 Swept away in the tides of Your spirit
.C                Dm
 Your hope will not resign
.                    Am
 Your grace cannot run dry

 I will dive into You
 CHORUS

 For all my days
.       Am7     G       F
 In Your shadow I will remain
.          Am7      G
 Oh I could stay here forever
.Dm7
 By Your side
.  Am7           G     F
 I know You won't shy away
.    Am7      G
 I am never forsaken
 VERSE 2
 In the dark and sleepless nights
 To You I'm holding tight
 I will rest in the depths of Your mercy
 You drench my weary soul
 Your Spirit overflows
 Here I soak in Your love

 It's surging in my heart

 Forever I am found in You my God

 My feet had wandered far

 But now I'm where You are

 Forever I am found in You my God</lyrics>
