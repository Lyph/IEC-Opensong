[C1]
   Chorus:
.             C          G   D/F#   Em
   Bless the Lord, O my soul, o my soul,
.    C          G   Dsus4 D
   Worship His holy name. 
.              C     Em     C  D  Em
   Sing like never before, o my soul.

 Verse 1:
.      C       G           D      Em
 The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning;
.C             G         D     Em
 It's time to sing Your song again.
.    C         G             D            Em
 Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me,
.C2         G               Dsus4  D  G Gsus4 G
 Let me be singing when the even-ing comes.   

[V3]
 Verse 2:
.        C       G                 D    Em
 You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger.
.       C       G               D       Em
 Your name is great, and Your heart is kind.
.     C        G                 D     Em
 For all Your goodness, I will keep on singing;
.C2            G           Dsus4    D   G  Gsus4G
 Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.

[V4]
 Verse 3:
.    C        G             D        Em
 And on that day when my strength is failing,
.    C          G             D      Em
 The end draws near, and my time has come;
.   C      G                     D     Em
 Still my soul will sing Your praise unending;
.C2             G              Dsus4   D   G  Gsus4G
 Ten thousand years and then fore - - vermore!

[V5]
.Em    C            D    Em
 I'll worship Your holy name.
.            C           D    G
 Yes, I'll worship Your holy name.
