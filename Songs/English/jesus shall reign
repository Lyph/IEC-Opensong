<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus shall reign where'er the sun Does his successive journeys run; His kingdom stretch from shore to shore Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

[V2]
 For Him shall endless prayer be made, And praises throng to crown His head; His Name, like sweet perfume shall rise With every morning sacrifice.

[V3]
 People and realms of every tongue Dwell on His love with sweetest song; And infant voices shall proclaim Their early blessings on His Name.

[V4]
 Blessings abound where'er He reigns; The prisoner leaps to lose his chains, The weary find eternal rest, And all the sons of want are blest.

[V5]
 Where He displays His healing power Death and the curse are known no more; In Him the tribes of Adam boast More blessings than their father lost.

[V6]
 Let every creature rise and bring
 Peculiar honors to our King,
 Angels descend with songs again,
 And earth repeat the loud Amen.</lyrics>
