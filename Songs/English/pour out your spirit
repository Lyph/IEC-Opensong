<title>Pour Out Your Spirit</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Adonai, here I am
 You are strong in my weakness
 And in the desert You revive me
 You give rest to my soul

[V2]
 Pour out Your Spirit
 Pour out Your Spirit
 So that I might become like You, Adonai

[V3]
 Oh Lord, take hold of me
 Not my will but Yours
 I will wait upon You on my knees
 Surely I will see Your Glory

[V4]
 That I might see as You see
 That I might love as You love, Adonai</lyrics>
