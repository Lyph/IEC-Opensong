 Who has the power over slavery's hand?
 Who has the power to free a man?
 Who has the power who holds the throne?
 Oh, my sweet Lord
 Who has the power to part the sea?
 Who has the power to rescue me?
 Who has the power to save my soul?
 Oh, my sweet Lord

[C1]
   Glory, hallelujah
   On Jordan's stormy banks I stand
   Glory, hallelujah
   I'm longing for the promised land

[V2]
 Who has the power to heal the heart?
 Who has the power to light the dark?
 Who has the power to make me whole?
 Oh, my sweet Lord
 Who has the power to conquer death?
 Who has the power to raise the dead?
 Who has the power who holds the world?
 Oh, my sweet Lord

[C2]
   Glory, hallelujah
   On Jordan's stormy banks I stand
   Glory, hallelujah
   I'm longing for the promised land

[B1]
   Is there no balm in Gilead?
   Is there no healer there?
   Can boundless love ever reject
   Any soul that's in despair?
   Who has the power?
   Who has the power?
   Who has the power?
   Oh, my sweet Lord

[C3]
   Glory, hallelujah
   My feet will stand in the
   Promised land, oh
   Glory, hallelujah
   My soul will rest in the Savior's hands

[C4]
   Sing glory
   Sing glory, my sweet Lord

[V3]
 Verse: 3 (Tedashii)
 Yea, uh, uh, uh
 On the banks of the river looking for chances to get up
 Stir up the pool and bring healing to bones that's feeling brittle
 I've been beat up in the streets, but I believe something's coming
 There's no way I can move unless You choose to do something
 This life, this life is so heavy; lost my son, he in heaven
 I was chasing this leaven
 Hanging with dudes that is deadly, but this life is now over
 Moreover I'm ready go on
 I'm ready to change it all
 Lord, just help me I'm all in
 On the banks of the river
 Looking out for the promised land
 Tell Him I need Him now, I don't have any other plans
 Sweet Lord, I know I need You
 There's relief from the grief when I see You

[V4]
 I sing, &quot;Glory, hallelujah!&quot;
 We sing glory, sing glory</lyrics>
