 Shepherd of my thankful heart
 Ever faithful friend you are
 Healer who now bears the scars
 Of Love's amazing grace

[V2]
 Heaven's Song made flesh for us
 Crucified upon the cross
 Now in glory, Jesus
 To you belongs all praise

[V3]
 Be glorified in me
 Be glorified in me
 Be glorified in me
 Jesus, my King

[V4]
 Sacrifice, no words could tell
 Majesty on earth to dwell
 Living Word, Emmanuel
 I'll love you all my days
 Maker of the stars above
 Praise of angels ever sung
 King of Glory, King of Love
 Let all creation praise</lyrics>
