<lyrics>[V1]
 Souls of men! why will ye scatter Like a crowd of frightened sheep? Foolish hearts! why will ye wander From a love so true and deep? Was there ever kinder shepherd Half so gentle, half so sweet, As the Savior who would have us Come and gather round His feet?

[V2]
 It is God: His love looks mighty, But is mighti'r than it seems; 'Tis our Father: and His fondness Goes far out beyond our dreams. There's a wideness in God's mercy, Like the wideness of the sea; There's a kindness in His justice, Which is more than liberty.

[V3]
 There is no place where earth's sorrows Are more felt than up in Heav'n; There is no place where earth's failings Have such wondrous judgment giv'n. There is welcome for the sinner, Grace poured out as in a flood There is mercy with the Savior; There is healing in His blood.

[V4]
 There is grace enough for thousands Of new worlds as great as this; There is room for fresh creations In that upper home of bliss. For the love of God is broader Than the measure of man's mind; And the heart of the Eternal Is most wonderfully kind.

[V5]
 There is plentiful redemption In Christ's blood that has been shed; There is joy for all the members In the sorrows of the Head. Not just all we owe to Jesus; It is something more than all; Greater good because of evil, Larger mercy through the fall.</lyrics>
