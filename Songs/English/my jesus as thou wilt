 My Jesus, as Thou wilt! Oh, may Thy will be mine! Into Thy hand of love I would my all resign; Through sorrow, or through joy, conduct me as Thine own, And help me still to say, my Lord, Thy will be done!

[V2]
 My Jesus, as Thou wilt! If needy here and poor, Give me Thy people's bread, their portion rich and sure. The manna of Thy Word Let my soul feed upon; And if all else should fail, my Lord, thy will be done!

[V3]
 My Jesus, as Thou wilt! Though seen through many'a tear, Let not my star of hope grow dim or disappear; Since Thou on earth hast wept, and sorrowed oft alone, If I must weep with Thee, my Lord, Thy will be done!

[V4]
 My Jesus, as Thou wilt! All shall be well for me; Each changing future scene I gladly trust with Thee: Straight to my home above I travel calmly on, And sing, in life or death, my Lord, Thy will be done!</lyrics>
