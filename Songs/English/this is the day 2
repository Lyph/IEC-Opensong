 This is the day, the Lord has made
.E/G#                            A
 Let us be glad - Give Him praise
.E/B           E7/B        A
 Rejoicing now that we are saved
 That's why

 Everybody in the church is dancing

 Your mercy makes us celebrate
 And revel in Your lavish grace
 This joy we've got to demonstrate
 That's why
 Everybody in the church is dancing
