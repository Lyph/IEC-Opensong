<lyrics>[V1]
 Ere you left your room this morning, Did you think to pray? In the name of Christ our Savior, Did you sue for loving favor, As a shield today? O how praying rests the weary! Prayer will change the night to day; So when life seems dark and dreary, Don't forget to pray.

[V2]
 When you met with great temptation, Did you think to pray? By His dying love and merit, Did you claim the Holy Spirit As your guide and stay? O how praying rests the weary! Prayer will change the night to day; So when life seems dark and dreary, Don't forget to pray.

[V3]
 When your heart was filled with anger, Did you think to pray? Did you plead for grace, my brother, That you might forgive another Who had crossed your way? O how praying rests the weary! Prayer will change the night to day; So when life seems dark and dreary, Don't forget to pray.

[V4]
 When sore trials came upon you, Did you think to pray? When your soul was bowed in sorrow, Balm of Gilead did you borrow At the gates of day? O how praying rests the weary! Prayer will change the night to day; So when life seems dark and dreary, Don't forget to pray.</lyrics>
