<lyrics>[V1]
.         Em
 Take me past the outer court
.     Cmaj7
 And through the Holy Place,
.  D
 Past the brazen altar,
.    Em   D
 Lord, I want to see Your face.
.   Em
 Pass me by the crowds of people,
.    Cmaj7
 And the priests who sing their praise;
.   D
 I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness,
.     Am7  D
 But it's only found one place.

[C1]
.      Em        D
   Take me into the Holy of holies,
.      Am7   C      Em Cmaj7
   Take me in by the blood of the Lamb;
.   D   Em         D
   Take me into the Holy of holies,
.       Am7        D       C
   Take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am.
.       Am7  D       Em
   Take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am.</lyrics>
