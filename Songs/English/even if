 Intro: F Gm F Gm
 Verse 1
.     F
 They say sometimes you win some
. C
 Sometimes you lose some
.     Dm
 And right now
.        C   Bb
 Right now I'm losing bad
.   F
 I've stood on this stage
.       Gm
 Night after night
.  C
 Reminding the broken
 It'll be alright
.      Dm
 But right now
.       C   Bb
 Oh right now I just can't
.    C
 It's easy to sing
.      Dm           Bb
 When there's nothing to bring me down
.  C
 But what will I say
.   Dm
 When I'm held to the flame
.    Bb
 Like I am right now
 Chorus:
.F
 I know You're able
 And I know You can
.C
 Save through the fire
 With Your mighty hand
.  Dm
 But even if You don't
. Bb          F
 My hope is You alone
 Verse 2:
.      F
 They say it only takes a little faith
.    C
 To move a mountain
.  F   Dm
 Well Good thing
.             C    Bb
 A little faith is all I have right now
.  C
 But God when You choose
.     Dm        Bb
 To leave mountains unmovable
.  C
 Give me the strength
.     Dm
 To be able to sing
.      Bb
 It is well with my soul
 Chorus 2:
.F
 I know You're able
 And I know You can
.C
 Save through the fire
 With Your mighty hand
.  Dm
 But even if You don't
. Bb
 My hope is You alone
.F
 I know the sorrow
 I know the hurt
.  C
 Would all go away
 If You'd just say the word
.  Dm
 But even if You don't
. Bb
 My hope is You alone
 Bridge:
 You've been faithful
.      F
 You've been good
.       C
 All of my days
.    Dm     Bb       F
 Jesus, I will cling to You
.    C
 Come what may
.        Bb
 'Cause I know You're able

[V2]
 I know You can
