.E                   A
 A refuge for the poor,
.                      E
 a shelter for the storm:
.           A
 this is our God.
.E                          A
 He will wipe away your tears
.                           E
 and return your wasted years:
.           A
 this is our God.

[P1]
.   F#m7
   So call upon His name,
.        A
   He is mighty to save:
.             E
   this is our God.

[V2]
 A father to the orphan,
 a healer to the broken:
 this is our God.
 He brings peace to our madness
 and comfort in our sadness:
 this is our God.

[C1]

   Jesus, Lord and Savior:

[V3]
 A fountain for the thirsty,
 a lover for the lonely:
 this is our God.
 He brings glory to the humble
 and crowns for the faithful:
 this is our God.

[C2]
   You are the One we have waited for.
   You are the One we have waited for.
   You are the One we have waited for.
   Jesus, Lord and Savior:
   This is our God.

[B1]
.  A E/G# F#m      E/G#   A
   Jesus, Lord and Savior:
.              E
   This is our God.</lyrics>
