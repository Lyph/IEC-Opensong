.G.                 D
 We bow our hearts, we lift our hands
.    Em.             C
 We turn our eyes to You again
.    G.                   D
 And we surrender to the truth
.     Em.            C
 That all we need is found in You

[C1]
.   G.          D
   Receive our adoration
.   Em.            C
   Jesus, Lamb of God
.  G.             D
   Receive our adoration
.   Em.           C
   How wonderful You are

[V2]
 We choose to leave it all behind
 And turn our eyes towards the prize
 The upward call of God in Christ
 You have our hearts Lord, take our lives

[B1]
.   C.                D
   Every soul You've saved sings out
   Everything You've made resounds
   All Creation's standing now
   Lifting up Your Name
   We're caught up in the angels' song
   We're gathered to Your ancient throne
   Children in our Father's arms
   Shouting out Your praise</lyrics>
