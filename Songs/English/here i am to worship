<lyrics>[V1]
.E            Bsus               F#m
 Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness,
.E         Bsus         A
 Opened my eyes, let me see;
.E           Bsus      F#m
 Beauty that made this heart adore You,
.E         Bsus            A
 Hope of a life spent with You.

[C1]
.               E                     B/D#
   Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down,
.               E/G#               A
   Here I am to say that You're my God;
.                    E                  B/D#
   You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy,
.             E/G#         A
   Altogether wonderful to me.

[V2]
.E           Bsus        F#m
 King of all days, oh so highly exalted,
.E           Bsus    A
 Glorious in Heaven above;
.E          Bsus        F#m
 Humbly You came to the earth You created,
.E              Bsus        A
 All for love's sake became poor.

[B1]
.             B/D#  E/G#     A
   (And) I'll never know how much it cost

[B2]
.     B/D#   E/G# A
   To see my sin upon that cross.</lyrics>
