 Verse 1:
.A           E       D
 Before the Earth was made You were living
.A       E          D
 And over every heart you've been singing
.A           E     D
 Your very word spoke life into being
.A         E        D
 You even give the breath we are breathing

[C1]
   Pre Chorus:
.  Hm          F#m        E
   And now, we sing our songs back to You
.  Hm          F#m        E
   Oh Lord, we gladly lay down our lives at your feet
.  Hm        F#m      E
   And we take the breath you gave
.  Hm        F#m     E
   And we give it back in praise

[C2]

 Verse 2:
 Stepping down into the world you made
 The uncreated God in a human frame
 Creator dwelling with creation
 You made yourself of no reputation

[B2]
   Bridge:
   And you made yourself nothing for us
   And you gave up your life for the least of men
   You entered the gates of death
   And rose with the keys in your hand

[V3]
 Middle 8:
.F#m   E/Ab  A
 There is no one like You
.F#m   E/Ab A
 There is none besides You</lyrics>
