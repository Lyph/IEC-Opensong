<title>Glimmer In The Dust</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 VERSE 1
 I was lost in a moment
 A glimmer in time
 Like a child chasing shadows
 My back to the light
 I was lost in a fog till
 You caught my eye
 Through the smoke and the mirrors
 A glimmer of life

[V2]
 CHORUS
 I know there's a place I belong
 Where I'll see the fullness of love
 A child face to face with my God Lost in
 Your awesome wonder While I wait
 I will not be afraid
 My faith will remain all the same
 My hope in the things not yet seen
 Found in the greatest of these

[V3]
 VERSE 2
 I found love in a moment
 Exploding in light
 At the cross where the curtains
 Were ripped from my eyes
 I found heaven in pieces
 In glimmer and dust
 Broken glass in reflection
 Till we shine like the sun

[V4]
 BRIDGE
 I know that You love me I know that
 You love me Your love never fails
 Your love never fails
 When all's said and done
 All that matters is love
 So let love take over
 Not just in part
 But in all that You are
 Let Your love take over</lyrics>
