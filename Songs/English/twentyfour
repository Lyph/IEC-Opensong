.            G                     Cadd9
 Twenty four oceans... Twenty four skies...
.            D/F#                    G
 Twenty four failures... Twenty four tries...
.            Em                           Cadd9
 Twenty four finds me... In twenty-fourth place
.            D/F#                           G
 Twenty four drop outs... At the end of the day.

[V2]
.                   Em
 Life is not what I thought it was...
.            Cadd9
 Twenty four hours ago.
.                  D/F#                           G
 Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You.
.                  Em                        Cadd9
 And I'm not who I thought I was twenty four hours ago.
.                  D/F#                           G
 Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You.

[V3]
.            G                         Cadd9
 Twenty four reasons to admit that I'm wrong
.            D/F#                      G
 With all my excuses still twenty four strong.
.    Em              Cadd9            D/F#             Cadd9
 See I'm not copping out, not copping out, not copping out
.                        D/F#
 When You're raising the dead in me.

[C1]
.  G
   Oh, oh I am the second man.
.  Em                         Cadd9
   Oh, oh I am the second man now.
.                          D/F#
   Oh, I am the second man now.

[V4]
.                                     G
 And You're raising these twenty four voices...
.                Cadd9
 With twenty four hearts
.               D/F#
 With all of my symphonies...
.               G
 In twenty four parts.
.                   Em
 But I wanna be one today...
.             Cadd9
 Centered and true.
.            D/F#                           G
 I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You.
.                   D/F#
 You're raising the dead in me.

[C2]
.  G
   Oh, oh I am the second man
.  Em                         Cadd9
   Oh, oh I am the second man now
.                             D/F#
   Oh, I am the second man now
.                                   GEmCadd9D/F#
   And You're raising the dead in me

[V5]
.              G                       Cadd9
 I want to see miracles, see the world change.
.             D/F#                   G
 Wrestled the angel, for more than a name,
.                Em                       Cadd9
 For more than a feeling, for more than a cause.
.            D/F#                           G
 I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You
.                       D/F#
 And You're raising the dead in me.
