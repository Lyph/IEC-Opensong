.D        Em
 Open our eyes, Lord,
.A7             G D
 We want to see Jesus;
.Bm               Em
 To reach out and touch Him,
.A7              G    D
 And say that we love Him.

[V2]
.D        Em
 Open our ears, Lord,
.A7             G  D
 And help us to listen;
.Bm       Em
 Open our eyes, Lord,
.A7             G D
 We want to see Jesus</lyrics>
