.Badd9                            B7
 Yesterday, I thought I heard you speak to me,
.            G#m
 Giving me a song to sing,
.      C#m                    F#
 And I can't get it out of my head.
.   Badd9                             B7
 So hard to sing the words behind the melody;
.                       C#m
 You're whispering Your heart to me,
.            F#
 But there's no way to speak it.
.          E
 So go out ahead,
.            G#m
 And lead me on
 To the places I
.     Bm         F#
 have never been before.

[C1]
.  Badd9                F#
   Let Your glory be my song.
.  G#m
   Let it shine on me.
.  Bm
   Let it shine on me.
.  B                   F#
   Let salvation be my song.
.  G#m
   Let it shine on,
.  E
   Shine on me.

[V2]
.Badd9                               B7
 You and me - it's beyond my wildest fantasy
.                     C#m
 That You would bring eternity
.        F#
 For the whole world to sing it.

[B1]
   I've got a song in my soul and it sings for You. (10x)</lyrics>
