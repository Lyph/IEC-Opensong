<lyrics>[V1]
.E
  Through You the blind will see.
 Through You the mute will sing.
.A2
  Through You the dead will rise.
 Through You all hearts will praise
.C#m7                           Bsus
  Through You the darkness flees.
.                                    E
 Through You my heart screams, &quot;I am free!&quot;

[C1]
.        E
   I am free to run!
   (I am free to run!)
.        A2
   I am free to dance! (I am free to dance!)
.        C#m7                       Bsus
   I am free to live for You! (I am free to live for You!)
.            E
   I am free! (I am free!)

[V2]
.E
  Through You the kingdom comes.
 Through You the battle's won.
.A2
  Through You I'm not afraid.
 Through You the price is paid.
.C#m7                     Bsus
  Through You this victory.
.                                     E
 Because of You my heart sings, &quot;I am free!&quot;

[C2]
.        E
   I am free to run! (I am free to run!)

   I am free to live for You! (I am free to live for You!)

   I am free! (I am free!)
   Yes, I am free! (I am free!)
