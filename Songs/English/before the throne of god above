 Before the throne of God above
 I have a strong, a perfect plea;
 A great High Priest, whose name is Love,
 Who ever lives and pleads for me.

[V2]
 My name is graven on His hands,
 My name is written on His heart;
 I know that while in heaven He stands
 No tongue can bid me thence depart.

[V3]
 When Satan tempts me to despair,
 And tells me of the guilt within,
 Upward I look, and see Him there
 Who made an end of all my sin.

[V4]
 Because the sinless Saviour died,
 My sinful soul is counted free;
 For God, the Just, is satisfied
 To look on Him and pardon me.

[V5]
 Behold Him there! the risen Lamb!
 My perfect, spotless, Righteousness,
 The great unchangeable I AM,
 The King of glory and of grace!

[V6]
 One with Himself, I cannot die;
 My soul is purchased by His blood;
 My life is hid with Christ on high,
 With Christ, my Saviour and my God.</lyrics>
