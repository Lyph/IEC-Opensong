<lyrics>[V1]
 Wonderful Lord so full of grace, So full of mercy
 Mighty you are, with power to save, Power to heal
 And I will worship you, I give my life to you

[V2]
 You are faithful to me and will never cease to be
 All your promises will come to pass in your power and sovereignty
 You are faithful and true perfect timing in all you do
 So I'll never stop trusting you

[V3]
 You are God and you are good, so good to me
 Great is Your love, you lift up my head
 When darkness surrounds me
 Tender You are, holding me close,
 You never let go</lyrics>
