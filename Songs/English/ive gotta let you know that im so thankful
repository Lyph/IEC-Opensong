<lyrics>[V1]
 Iʼve gotta let You know that Iʼm so thankful
 For everything You have done
 The way You lifted me, and turned my life around
 Now in You I am found

[P1]
   So put your hands up, everybody give Him glory
   Hands up

[C1]
   Everybody shout your praise aloud
   And sing with everything
   Give Him all the glory, for our God is worthy
   Whoa

[V2]
 BRIDGE: (Riff)
 If you love Him donʼt stop praising, put your hands up
 If you love Him donʼt stop praising, put your hands up
 Everybody give Him glory, put your hands up
 Put your hands up Put your hands up</lyrics>
