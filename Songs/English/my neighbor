<lyrics>[V1]
 Unclean and battered, torn by sin, By things I do, my thoughts within, I lie there bloodied on life's road with death and sin my only load.

[V2]
 Across that road the world passed by turning a deaf ear to my cry, No help to give, they could not save and so they left me for my grave.

[V3]
 And, what of me, when I saw need? Did I my Savior's bidding heed? Too often on the other side I've walked away because of pride.

[V4]
 Sin bleeds from me and stops my breath, in Adam all I know is death; My works are rags, my offerings vain, From dust I came in dust remain.

[V5]
 But in my need my Savior died, Not passing on the other side. Rebreathed His Spirit in my dust, bound up my wounds, declared me just.

[V6]
 Now safe within His Church I'm free; Blood, Water, Spirit plead for me,
 The Ark of God, the Inn of Grace Where I behold my Father's face.

[V7]
 May I in Christ my neighbor know Binding his wounds serves Christ below.
 Your love for him make plain through me, that he may, too, your Glory see.

[V8]
 You loved me when I could not love, For my sin barred me from above.
 In Christ my love is now set free, O praise and bless the Trinity.</lyrics>
