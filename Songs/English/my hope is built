.   E                B                 A                B        E
 My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
.  E                  B                   A              B      E
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.

[V2]
.     E                  B              A             B        E
 When darkness veils His lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace.
.   E              B               A                B      E
 In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil.

[V3]
.    E             B
 His oath, His covenant, His blood
.   A              B        E
 support me in the whelming flood;
.     E             B                  A              B        E
 When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay.

[V4]
.     E                  B                A             B      E
 When He shall come with trumpet sound, O may I then in Him be found;
.        E               B                A               B        E
 Dressed in His righteousness alone, faultless to stand before the throne.

[C1]
.     E                 A
   On Christ, the solid rock I stand;
.      E                       B
   All other ground is sinking sand,
.      A               B       E
   All other ground is sinking sand.</lyrics>
