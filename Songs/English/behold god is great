 Verse:
.Am  G-Dm
 Behold, God is great and we do not know Him
 Behold God is great who can number his years
 He's so much bigger than any image I've made in my head
 So much greater than any story book I've read, yeah

[C1]
   Pre chorus:
.  Am G-Dm
   Who is this that sits above the circle of the earth
   And who is this that stretches out the heavens like a curtain
   And who is this that measures the waters
   In the hollow of His hand

[C2]
   Chorus:
.  Am   G   F Dm
   So lift up your eyes to the heavens
   And behold your God
   Lift up your eyes to the heavens
   He's so much bigger than, He's so much greater than
   Lift up your eyes

[B1]
   Post bridge:
.  Am G F F
   Who am I to question You
   Who am I that I might accuse
   Who am I to think that You owe me a debt

[B2]
   Bridge:
.  G-Am   G-Am   F-Em
   Let the fear of the Lord return to the land
   And all Your people cry holy, holy</lyrics>
