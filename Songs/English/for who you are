<lyrics>[V1]
.G
  Standing here, in your presence
.C                                     G
  Thinking of the good things you have done
 Waiting here patiently
.C                                     Em
  Just to hear your still small voice again

   Holy, righteous, Faithful to the end

    Savior, healer, Redeemer and friend

[C1]
.                 G

   I will worship You for Who you are

   I will worship You for Who you are, Jesus
