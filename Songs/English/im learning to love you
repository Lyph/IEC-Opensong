.  F2                                       C
   We are like shadows that change with the day;
.  F2                                    C
   And like the flowers, our beauty will fade.
.  Cm/Eb                             F
   But Your's is the kingdom and the power,
.  Cm/Eb                  F                   G   Am7 G/BCGAm7G/BC
   Forever and ever, Your glory will always remain.</lyrics>
