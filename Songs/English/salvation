.E
 Salvation, spring up from the ground.
 Lord, rend the heavens and come down.
 Seek the lost and heal the lame.
 Jesus, bring glory to Your name.
 Let all the prodigals run home.
 All of creation waits and groans.
 Lord, we've heard of Your great fame.
 Father, cause all to shout Your name.

[C1]
.  B           C#m       A   B
   Stir up our hearts, O God.
.           C#m        A           B
   Open our spirits to awe who You are.
.        C#m          A2/C#  E/B
   Put a cry in us so deep inside
.       A     E/G# Bsus/F# E/F# Esus A2  E/G#
   That we cannot  find    the  words we need
.     Esus Em   Cmaj7        Am/C Cmaj7
   We just weep  and cry out to   You.</lyrics>
