<lyrics>[V1]
.D                       A
 I will bless the Lord forever
.D                       A
 I will trust Him at all times
.D                        A
 He has delivered me from all fear
.D                         A
 He has set my feet upon a rock

[P1]
.  D             Bm
   I will not be moved
.      D               E
   And I'll say of the Lord

[C1]
.             A          Bm
   You are my shield, my strength
.     D          Esus E
   My portion, deliverer
.     A
   My shelter, strong tower
.     D            E               D
   My very present help in time of need

[V2]
.D                     A
 Whom have I in heaven but You
.D                       A
 There's none I desire besides You
.D                Bm
 You have made me glad
.    D               E
 And I'll say of the Lord</lyrics>
