 1 verse:
.  Bb
 I feel it in my bones, You're about to move
.  Gm
 I feel it in the wind, You're about to ride in
.    Bb
 You said that You would pour Your spirit out
.   Eb
 You said that You would fall on sons and daughters

[C1]

.             Gm                     Bb
   So let the rain come drench us in love

   Let Your glory rush in like a flood

   To know Your presence and see Your beauty
