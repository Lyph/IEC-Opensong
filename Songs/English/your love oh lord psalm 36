.     G            C9               G      D/F#
 Your love, oh Lord, reaches to the heavens.
.     Em7         C9                G  D/F#
 Your faithfulness stretches to the sky;
.Em7           C9                      G       D/F#
 Your righteousness is like the mighty mountain,
.         Em7           C9               G    D/F#
 And Your justice flows like the ocean's tides.

[C1]
.                     D        C9             G
   And I will lift my voice to worship You my King;
.                     D               C9             Am   D
   And I will find my strength in the shadow of Your wings.</lyrics>
