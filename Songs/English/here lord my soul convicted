<lyrics>[V1]
 O Lord, my soul convicted stands Of breaking all Thy ten commands: And on me justly might'st Thou pour Thy wrath in one eternal show'r.

[V2]
 But thanks to God, its loud alarms Have warn'd me of approaching harms; And now, O Lord, my wants I see, Lost and undone, I come to Thee.

[V3]
 I know my fig leaf righteousness Can ne'er Thy broken law redress; Yet in the gospel plan I see, There's hope of pardon e'en for me.

[V4]
 There, I behold with wonder, Lord! That Christ hath to Thy law restor'd Those honors on th'atoning day, Which guilty sinners took away.

[V5]
 Amazing wisdom, pow'r and love, Display'd to rebels from above! Do Thou, O Lord, my faith increase To love and trust Thy plan of grace.</lyrics>
