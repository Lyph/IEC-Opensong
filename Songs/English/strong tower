 When I wander through the desert
 And I'm longing for my home
 All my dreams have gone astray
 When I'm stranded in the valley
 And I'm tired and all alone
 It seems like I've lost my way

[P1]
   I go running to your mountain
   Where your mercy sets me free

[C1]
   You are my strong tower shelter over me
   Beautiful and mighty everlasting King
   You are my strong tower fortress when I'm weak
   Your name is true and holy and Your face is all I seek

[V2]
 In the middle of my darkness
 In the midst of all my fear
 You're my refuge and my hope
 When the storm of life is raging
 And the thunder's all I hear
 You speak softly to my soul</lyrics>
