<lyrics>[V1]
.C#m               E                  A            E
 I'm here with the others who saw the heavens testify.
.C#m             E                 A            B                C#m
 Now I hang back in the shadows; I want to come close, I want to know.
.            E                   A                 E
 She sees me shivering here, she smiles and with a nod,
.C#m                E
 I walk through the mud and straw
.       A              E
 to the newborn Son of God.

[V2]
.C#m         E                         A            E
 He raises a wrinkled hand through the dust and the flies.
.C#m                  E
 Wrapped in rags like we are
.         A           B                 C#m
 and with barely open eyes, He takes my finger
.       E                    A         E
 And He won't let go, and he won't let go.
.C#m                 E                     A             E
 It's nothing like I knew before, and it's all I need to know.

[C1]
.  E
   Come let us adore Him; He has
   come down to this barren land
.           B
   Where we live,
.            A               B
   And all I have to give Him
.     A    E
   is Adoration.

[B1]
.  A
   God is with us here,
.  D
   Our Immanuel.
.  A
   God is with us here,
.  D
   Our Immanuel.</lyrics>
