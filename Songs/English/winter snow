<lyrics>[V1]
 Could've come like a mighty storm
 with all the strength of a hurricane
 You could've come like a forest fire
 with the power of heaven in your flame

[C1]
   But you came like a winter snow
   quiet and soft and slow
   Falling from the sky in the night
   to the earth below

[V2]
 Could've swept in like a tidal wave
 or an ocean to ravish our hearts
 You could have come through like a roaring flood
 to wipe away the things we've scarred

[B1]
   No, your voice wasn't in a bush burning
   No, your voice wasn't in a rushing wind
   It was still, it was small, it was hidden</lyrics>
