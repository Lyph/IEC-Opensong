<lyrics>[V1]
.         Fmaj9            Am7
 A world undone, choked by sin
.         Am7     C/B    C
 We were dead, we needed Him
.       Fmaj9            Am7
 From a place of endless love
.         G
 Came the Son

[C1]
.  C            C/B
   All hail the Lamb
.       Am7      Fmaj9
   He is worthy, only
.  C           C/B
   All eyes on Him
.          Am7   Fmaj9
   His the glory, only

[V2]
 In our place, blood was shed
 Flesh was torn and cruelly bled
 Hideous and glorious
 Died the Son

[V3]
 Death undone, victory claimed
 He was dead but lives again
 By the Spirit now in us
 Rose the Son

[B1]
.  G    Am7   Fmaj9
   Only He is worthy

[V4]
 He'll return, clothed in light
 Every eye drawn to the sight
 With final authority
 Comes the Son</lyrics>
