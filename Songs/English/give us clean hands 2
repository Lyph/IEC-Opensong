.G
 We bow our hearts,
.D
 We bend our knees.
.C                    G
 Spirit, come make us humble.
.G
 We turn our eyes
.D
 From evil things;
.C
 Lord, we cast down our idols.

[C1]
.                G                   D
   Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts;
.         Em           D         G
   Let us not lift our souls to another. (2x)
.                G                    D
   O God, let us be a generation that seeks,
.                  Em       D      G
   That seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob. (2x)</lyrics>
