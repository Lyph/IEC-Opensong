 I've got a river of 
 Living water 
 A fountain that never will run dry
 It's open heavens You're releasing 
 And we will never be denied

[P1]
   Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells, 
   We're stirring up deep deep waters
   We're going to dance in the river, dance in the river
   Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells, 
   We're stirring up deep deep waters
   We're going to jump in the river, 
   Jump in the river

[C1]
   Deep cries out to deep cries out to You, 
   deep cries out to deep cries out to You
   We cry out to, we cry out to, You Jesus

[B1]
   We're falling into deeper waters, calling out to You
   We're walking into deeper waters, going after You</lyrics>
