<title>You are my song in the night silence</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 You are my song in the night silence,
 You are the first breath of my soul.
 I don't have the strength to dream without You,
 My dreams are in You and my whole world.

[V2]
 You are rock of my heart,
 There is no other happiness.
 Earthly treasures are like dust,
 You are more precious than the whole world.

[C1]
   Until there is a sun in the sky,
   Until the river runs to the river,
   I will not be tired of singing to
   You, my God, on earth.

[V3]
 You are my berth in the hours of anxiety,
 My house among the steep roads.
 You are the inspiration for the hearts,
 My God, my Friend, and my Creator.</lyrics>
