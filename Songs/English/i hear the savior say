.  G
 I hear the Savior say,
.      C                  G
 &quot;Your strength indeed is small;
.         Em7                 C
 Child of weakness, watch and pray
.        G       D      G
 Find in Me your all in all.&quot;

[C1]
.  G             Em7
   Jesus paid it all
.  G            D
   All to Him I owe;
.  G              C
   Sin had left a crimson stain
.     G         D        G
   He washed it white as snow

[V2]
.     G
 For nothing good have I
.      C                G
 Where-by Your grace to claim
.     Em7              C
 I'll wash my garments white
.       G        D         G
 in the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb

[V3]
.      G
 Lord, now indeed I find
.     C                  G
 Your pow'r, and Yours a-lone,
.    Em7                C
 Can change the leper's spots
.    G        D        G
 And melt the heart of stone</lyrics>
