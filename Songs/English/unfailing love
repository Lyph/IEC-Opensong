<lyrics>[V1]
 You have my heart, and I am Yours forever.
 You are my strength, God of grace and power.

[P1]
   And ev'rything
   You hold in Your hand.
   Still You make time for me; I can't understand.

[C1]
   Praise You, God of earth and sky;
   How beautiful is Your unfailing love,
   Unfailing love.
   And You never change,
   God, You remain the Holy One,
   And my unfailing love, unfailing love.

[V2]
 You are my rock, the One I hold on to.
 You are my song, and I sing for You.</lyrics>
