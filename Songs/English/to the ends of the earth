.Bm        G     D     A          Bm  G    D         A
 Love unfailing, overtaking my heart.  You take me in.
.Bm             G    D            A          G
 Finding peace again, fear is lost in all You are.

[P1]
.      A                                        Bm
   And I would give the world to tell Your story
.                                  G
   'Cause I know that You've called me,
.                           D
   I know that You've called me.
.       A                                G
   I've lost myself for good within Your promise,
.                  Bm                G
   And I won't hide it, I won't hide it.

[C1]
.  D                           A
   Jesus, I believe in You and I would go
.         Em                        G
   To the ends of the earth, to the ends of the earth.
.      D
   For You alone are the Son of God
.      C
   And all the world will see
.             Em             G
   That You are God, You are God</lyrics>
