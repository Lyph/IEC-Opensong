.D               Emin     G
 I come to the altar, and I
.           A   D
 bow before you.

 You are everything my

   Mercy has a face.

.D     Emin         G
 Every moment that I

 come to know you,
.D        Emin
 I find a new depth

 of love surrounding me.
.D           Emin                 G           A
 Deeper than oceans, higher than any mountain peak.
.C                                    Emin
 I'm so amazed at the wonder you hold,
.                 A
 I can hardly believe.
