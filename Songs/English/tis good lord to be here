<lyrics>[V1]
 'Tis good, Lord, to be here, Thy glory fills the night; Thy face and garments, like the sun, Shine with unborrowed light.

[V2]
 'Tis good, Lord, to be here, Thy beauty to behold Where Moses and Elijah stand, Thy messengers of old.

[V3]
 Fulfiller of the past, Promise of things to be, We hail Thy body glorified And our redemption see.

[V4]
 Before we taste of death, We see Thy Kingdom come; We fain would hold the vision bright And make this hill our home.

[V5]
 'Tis good, Lord, to be here. Yet we may not remain; But since Thou bidst us leave the mount, Come with us to the plain.</lyrics>
