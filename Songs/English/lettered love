 VERSE 1:
 Your Word shows
 How much You have loved me
 Sending Love to find me
 Reaching to my heart
 Now I see
 Lettered love has found me
 Littered red with mercy
 Written in Your scars
 Jesus

[V2]
 CHORUS 1:
 So have this broken heart
 And show me what Love paid for
 Oh Lord let my heart beat with Yours
 This lettered love
 Is shaping my story

[B1]
   TAG:
   All for the praise of Your Name
   All for the fame of Your glory
   Jesus be all that I seek
   Your presence is all that I need

[B2]
   BRIDGE:
   Like the sun and moon
   Like the night and noon
   Your Word is light to me
   And I'll praise You

[V3]
 Splitting death and life
 Like the earth and sky
 Your Word is light in me
 And I'll praise You

[V4]
 CHORUS 2:
 Lord have this broken heart
 For this broken heart is paid for
 And shaped by the truth of Your Word
 This lettered love
 Has written my story

[V5]
