 Now the darkness fades into new beginnings
 As we lift our eyes to a hope beyond
 All creation waits with an expectation
 To declare the reign of the Lord our God

[C1]
   We will not be moved when the earth gives way
   For the risen One has overcome
   And for every fear there's an empty grave
   For the risen One has overcome

[V2]
 Now the silence breaks in the name of Jesus
 As the heavens cry let the earth respond
 All creation shouts with a voice of triumph
 To declare the reign of the Lord our God

[C2]
   We will not be moved when the earth gives way
   For the risen One has overcome
   And for every fear there's an empty grave
   For the risen One has overcome

[B1]
   He shall reign forever strongholds now surrender
   For the Lord our God has overcome
   Who can be against us? Jesus our Defender
   He is Lord and He has overcome

[C3]
   We will not be moved when the earth gives way
   For the risen One has overcome
   And for every fear there's an empty grave
   For the risen One has overcome</lyrics>
