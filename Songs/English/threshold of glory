<lyrics>[V1]
 We push back the gates, we open the door
 Together we come to meet with you Lord
 Yes, we push back the gates, we open the door
 Together we come, oh to meet with you Lord

[P1]
   Here we are at the threshold of glory
   Every eye now focused on you
   The heart in my chest beats wildly
   As each step bring us closer to you

[C1]
   Magnificent one merciful judge
   We rejoice and sing in the favor of our God

[V2]
 We push back the gates, we open the door
 Oh together we come to meet with you Lord
 We push back the gates, we open the door
 Together we come, oh to meet with you Lord

[C2]
   Magnificent one merciful judge
   We rejoice and sing in the favor of our God
   Omnipotent love almighty friend
   You are always just You are always good
   Your kingdom has no end

[B1]
   Magnificent one

[V3]
 (Magnificent, Magnificent
 Glorious, Glorious
 Magnificent, Magnificent
 Marvelous, Marvelous)</lyrics>
