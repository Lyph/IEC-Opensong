<lyrics>[V1]
.Am                              Am6
 You turned my way. You heard my cry.
.F/A                            G
 You turned my mourning into shouting.
.Am                     Am6
 Sorrow may last for a night,
.              F                G
 But with the light I am seeing,
 I am singing:

[C1]
.  C              G
   You lifted me out,
.                Am7
   You lifted me out,
.                F
   And set me dancing, dancing.
.   C               G
   Free. Now I am free.
.                    Am7
   Your love rescued me.
.                 F
   Now it's the anthem I'm singing.

[V2]
 Many will see, many will hear,
 And find You strong enough to save.
 Many the wonders You have done;
 Your light has come and I am seeing,
 I am singing:

[B1]
.  G
   Lost is where You found me,
.  Am7                          Fmaj7
   Shattered and frail, but You love me still.
.  G                      Am7
   Trouble may surround me, my heart may fail,
.          Fmaj7           Dm7
   But You never will, You never will.
