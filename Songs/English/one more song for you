 Staring at this old piano
 Playing through the memories that it holds
 Singing through the stories that it's told
 And all the prayers that have been lifted
 The leaps of faith, the giants slain
 Desperate cries, and broken praise

[P1]
   Have all the songs been sung?
   Is there still room for one?

[C1]
   Maybe one more hand in the air saying, &quot;You are holy&quot;
   One more shattered heart singing, &quot;You are good&quot;
   Maybe one more voice crying out for mercy
   One more hungry soul declaring, &quot;You're enough&quot;
   As long as there's breath in me
   Lord, there will always be
   One more song for You
   One more song for You

[V2]
 What can I offer You but weakness?
 All my life I tried to hide
 You brought it all into the light
 I'm still amazed that You would choose me
 If You can use the least of these
 Then there is no one You can't reach

[P2]
   In a world that's lost its song
   Show them there's still room for one

[C2]
   Maybe one more hand in the air saying, &quot;You are holy&quot;
   One more shattered heart singing, &quot;You are good&quot;
   Maybe one more voice crying out for mercy
   One more hungry soul declaring, &quot;You're enough&quot;
   As long as there's breath in me
   Lord, there will always be
   One more song

[B1]
   With no one here but You to listen
   My heat is bursting at the seams
   Out of all the songs I've lifted
   What I truly hope to see
   Is one more broken life made whole
   One more prodigal brought home
   What better way to praise Your name and majesty

[C3]
   Than one more hand in the air saying, &quot;You are holy&quot;
   One more shattered heart singing, &quot;You are good&quot;
   Maybe one more voice crying out for mercy
   One more hungry soul declaring, &quot;You're enough&quot;
   As long as there's breath in me (As long as there's breath in me)
   Lord, there will always be
   One more song for You
   One more song for Youn</lyrics>
