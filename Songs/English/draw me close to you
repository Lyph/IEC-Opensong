.A                D
 Draw me close to You,
.E            A
 never let me go
.E            D
 I lay it all down again
.F#m                  D
 To hear You say that I'm Your friend

[V2]
.A          D
 You are my desire,
.E                A
 No one else will do
.E                         D
 'Cause nothing else could take Your place
.F#m                   D
 To feel the warmth of Your embrace
.A                Bm
 Help me find the way
.E                A
 Bring me back to You

[C1]
.  A      E     D
   You're all I want

   You're all I've ever needed
.  A      E     D
   You're all I want
.  E                    A
   Help me know You are near</lyrics>
