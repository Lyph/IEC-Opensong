<lyrics>[V1]
.    A      B         C#m               A    B         C#m
     I keep trying to find a life on my own apart from You;
.A        B         C#m             A             B               C#m
 I am the king of excuses; I've got one for every selfish thing I do.

[V2]
.    A          B         C#m                      A        B         C#m
 The disease of self runs through my blood, it's a cancer fatal to my soul;
.A       B             C#m                A                   B        C#m
 Every attempt on my behalf has failed to bring this sickness under control.

[P1]
.  A            B    C#m             A        B     C#m
   What's going on inside of me? I despise my own behavior;
.            A            B    C#m                    A              B         C#m
   This only serves to confirm my suspicions that I'm still a man in need of a Savior.

[C1]
.          A         E        B              C#m
   I wanna be in the light as You are in the light.
.          A              E            B
   I wanna shine like the stars in the heavens.
.     A           E          B        C#m
   Oh Lord, be my light, and be my salvation,
.         A             B            C#m
   'Cause all I want is to be in the light,
.  A             B            C#m
   All I want is to be in the light.</lyrics>
