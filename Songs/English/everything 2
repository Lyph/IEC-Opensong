 Everything

[V2]
 Find me here and speak to me
 I want to feel you I need to hear you
 You are the light That's leading me
 To the place where I find peace again

[V3]
 You are the strength that keeps me walking
 You are the hope that keeps me trusting
 You are the life to my soul
 You are my purpose you are everything

[C1]
   And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you
   Would you tell me how could it be any better than this?

[V4]
 You calm the storms you give me rest
 You hold me in your hands you won't let me fall
 You steal my heart and you take my breath away
 Would you take me in would you take me deeper now

[C2]
   And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you
   Would you tell me how could it be any better than this?
   And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you
   Would you tell me how could it be any better than this?

[B1]
   Cause you're all I want, you are all I need, you are everything, everything
   You're all I want, you are all I need, you are everything, everything
   You're all I want, you are all I need, you are everything, everything
   You're all I want, you are all I need, you are everything, everything

[C3]
   And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you
   Would you tell me how could it be any better than this?
   And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you
   Would you tell me how could it be any better, any better than this?
   And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you
   Would you tell me how could it be any better than this?
   Would you tell me how could it be any better than this?</lyrics>
