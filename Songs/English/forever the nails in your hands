.    G                        Em7
 The nails in Your hands, the nails in Your feet,
.     C2                   Dsus    D
 They tell me how much You love me.
.    G                         Em7
 The thorns on Your brow, they tell me how
.    C2                    Dsus    D
 You bore so much shame to love me.

[P1]
.      
       Bm7 C2
   And when the heavens pass away,
.               Bm7                C2
   And all Your scars they still remain,
.         Bm7            C2
   And forever they will say
.  Am7          Dsus    DDsusDDsusD
   How much You love me.

[C1]
.     G                Em7
   Forever my love, forever my heart,
.     C2              Dsus  D
   Forever my life is Yours.
.     G                Em7
   Forever my love, forever my heart,
.     C2              Dsus  D
   Forever my life is Yours.</lyrics>
