<lyrics>[V1]
 I long to serve You Lord,I long to walk Your way
 I long to heed your words,You're the Potter I'm the clay.

[C1]
   So many times I have seen,so many times I have felt
   Holy blood on the cross You have shed,
   Your love and your grace for my soul.

[V2]
 I will open up my heart,I'll praise You with all of my strength
 I will seek You all of my days,I will follow all of Your ways.

[V3]
 Shout the news now to everyone,Hope is here Peace has come,
 Every debt has been repaid,Broken heart can be remade.</lyrics>
