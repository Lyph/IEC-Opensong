<lyrics>[V1]
.G
 I stand amazed in the presence
.   D         C2  G
 Of Jesus the Nazarene,
.    C2                  G/B
 And wonder how He could love me,
.  G          D         G
 A sinner, condemned, unclean.

[C1]
.  G
   How marvelous! How wonderful!
.  D
   And my song shall ever be:
.  G           D/F# Em7
   How marvelous!   How wonderful!
.  Am7   G/B      Dsus D   G
   Is my Savior's love for me!

[V2]
 For me it was in the garden
 He prayed: &quot;Not My will, but Thine.&quot;
 He had no tears for His own griefs,
 But sweat drops of blood for mine.

[V3]
 In pity angels beheld Him
 And came from the world of light
 To comfort Him in the sorrows
 He bore for my soul that night.

[V4]
 He took my sins and my sorrows,
 He made them His very own;
 He bore the burden to Calvary
 And suffered and died alone.

[V5]
 When with the ransmed in glory
 His face I at last shall see,
 'Twill be my joy through the ages
 To sing of His love for me.</lyrics>
