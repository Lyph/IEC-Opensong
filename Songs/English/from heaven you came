<lyrics>[V1]
.Am    E      Fmaj7
 From heaven You came, helpless babe,
.G       C      F C  G
 Entered our world, Your glory veiled;
.Am     E    Fmaj7
 Not to be served but to serve,
.G        C      F   C   G
 And give Your life that we might live.

[C1]
.   (G)   C  G     Am  Am7
   This is our God, t__he Servant King,
.       F    G      C   G
   He calls us now to follow Him,
.         C      C7    F   B7
   To bring our lives as a daily offering
.       C G      C
   Of worship to  the Servant King.

[V2]
.Am    E     Fmaj7
 There in the garden of tears,
.G     C      F C  G
 My heavy load He chose to bear;
.Am    E      Fmaj7
 His heart with sorrow was torn,
.G     C   F    C   G
 'Yet not My will but Yours', He said.

[V3]
.Am   E     Fmaj7
 Come see His hands and His feet,
.G       C     F  C  G
 The scars that speak of sacrifice;
.Am        E     Fmaj7
 Hands that flung stars into space
.G     C     F C G
 To cruel nails surrendered.

[V4]
.Am  E      Fmaj7
 So let us learn how to serve,
.G      C     F C     G
 And in our lives enthrone Him;
.Am      E   Fmaj7
 Each other's needs to prefer,
.G      C      F C G
 For it is Christ we're serving.</lyrics>
