<lyrics>[V1]
 Ascribe to the Lord, honor, And glory due His Name Worship in His holiness, Worthy is His pow'r and fame.

[V2]
 The Lord of glory thunders O'er great and mighty seas; His voice is so majestic, It breaks cedar to pieces.

[V3]
 His voice like a mighty flash, Shakes the desert of Kadesh, It makes bare the thick forest No other voice is its match.

[V4]
 The Lord sits upon His throne, That's set upon the flood. He gives strength to His people, Who put their trust in His word.

[V5]
 Ascribe to the Lord, honor, And glory due His Name, Worship Him in holiness Worthy is His might and fame.</lyrics>
