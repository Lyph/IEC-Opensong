<lyrics>[V1]
 In my wrestling and in my doubts
 In my failures You won't walk out
 Your great love will lead me through
 You are the peace in my troubled sea
 You are the peace in my troubled sea
 In the silence, You won't let go
 In the questions, Your truth will hold
 Your great love will lead me through
 You are the peace in my troubled sea
 You are the peace in my troubled sea
 My lighthouse, my lighthouse
 Shining in the darkness. I will follow You
 My lighthouse, my lighthouse
 I will trust the promise
 You will carry me safe to shore (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
 Safe to shore (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
 Safe to shore (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
 Safe to shore
 I won't fear what tomorrow brings
 With each morning I'll rise and sing
 My God's love will lead me through
 You are the peace in my troubled sea
 You are...</lyrics>
