<lyrics>[V1]
 Almighty God, Your Word is cast Like seed into the ground; Now let the dew of Heav'n descend, And righteous fruits abound.

[V2]
 Let not the foe of Christ and man This holy seed remove, But give it root in ev'ry heart To bring forth fruits of love.

[V3]
 Let not the world's deceitful cares The rising plant destroy. But let it yield a hundredfold The fruits of peace and joy.

[V4]
 Nor let Your Word so kindly sent To raise us to Your throne Return to You, and sadly tell That we reject Your Son.

[V5]
 Oft as the precious seed is sown, Your quick'ning grace bestow, That all whose souls the truth receive, Its saving power may know.

[V6]
 Great God, come down and on Your Word
 Your mighty power bestow,
 That all who hear the joyful sound,
 Your saving grace may know.</lyrics>
