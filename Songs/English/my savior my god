 I am not skilled to understand
.                                    Bm7
 What God has willed, what God has planned.
.                         A
 I only know at His right hand
.                       D2
 Stands one who is my Savior.

[V2]
 I take Him at His word and deed.
 Christ died to save me this I read.
 And in my heart I find a need
 Of Him to be my Savior.

[P1]
.                                    G2
   That He would leave His place on high
.                             D2
   And come for sinful man to die,
.                                   Asus
   You count it strange, so once did I,
.                     D2
   Before I knew my Savior.

[C1]
.            Bm7              G2
   My Savior loves. My Savior lives.
.                D2             A
   My Savior's always there for me.
.            Bm7            G2
   My God He was. My God He is.
.            D             A
   My God is always gonna be. (2X)

[V3]
 Yes, living, dying let me bring
 My strength, my solace
 from this spring:
 That He who lives to be my King
 Once died to be my Savior.</lyrics>
