<lyrics>[V1]
 I'm saying goodbye to any limitation
 I'm saying hello to the God of all creation
 There are no limits with you
 There are no limits with you

[C1]
   You're limitless, nothing's too hard for you
   You're limitless, there's nothing you cannot do
   You are bigger, and you're greater, and you're stronger I know
   You're limitless, you're limitless

[V2]
 There's no limits with Jesus when we walk with Him
 There's no limits inside of us cause He lives within
 We're breaking every limitation, nothing's gonna hold us back
 We'll keep exceeding the limits until He comes back

[B1]
   Lord, you are bigger
   Lord, you are greater
   Lord, you are stronger
   Than anything</lyrics>
