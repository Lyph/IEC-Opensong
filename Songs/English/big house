<lyrics>[V1]
.G                      Em               C
 I don't know where you lay your head or where you call your home.
.G                      Em                C
 I don't know where you eat your meals or where you talk on the phone.
.G                   Em            C
 I don't know if you got a cook, a butler, or a maid.
.G                   Em                C              D     C
 I don't know if you got a yard with a hammock in the shade.

[V2]
 I don't know if you got some shelter, say, a place to hide.
 I don't know if you live with friends in whom you can confide.
 I don't know if you got a family say a mom or dad.
 I don't know if you feel love at all, but I bet you wish you had.

[C1]
.  G                   C
   Come and go with me to my Father's house.
.  G                   C              G
   Come and go with me to my Father's house.
.                  D                           G
   It's a big, big house with lots and lots of room.
.               D                         G
   A big, big table with lots and lots of food.
.                  D                          G
   It's a big, big yard where we can play football.
.             D                       G
   A big, big house; it's my Father's house.

[V3]
 All I know is a big ol' house with rooms for everyone.
 All I know is lots of land where we can play and run.
 All I know is you need love and I've got a family.
 All I know is you're all alone, so why not come with me?</lyrics>
