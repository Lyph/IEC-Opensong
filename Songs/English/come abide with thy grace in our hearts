<lyrics>[V1]
 Abide, O dearest Jesus, Among us with Thy grace, That Satan may not harm us, Nor we to sin give place.

[V2]
 Abide, O dear Redeemer, Among us with Thy Word, And thus now and hereafter True peace and joy afford.

[V3]
 Abide with heav'nly brightness Among us, precious Light; Thy truth direct, and keep us From error's gloomy night.

[V4]
 Abide with richest blessings Among us, bounteous Lord; Let us in grace and wisdom Grow daily through Thy Word.

[V5]
 Abide with Thy protection Among us, Lord, our Strength, Lest world and Satan fell us And overcome at length.

[V6]
 Abide, O faithful Savior, Among us with Thy love;
 Grant steadfastness, and help us To reach our home above.</lyrics>
