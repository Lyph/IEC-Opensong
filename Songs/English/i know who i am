 I Know Who I Am&quot;

[V2]
 [2x]
 We are a chosen generation
 We've been called forth to show His excellence
 All I require for life, God has given me
 And I know who I am

[V3]
 [2x]
 I know who God says I am
 What He says I am
 Where He says I'm at
 I know who I am

[V4]
 [2x]
 I'm walking in power,
 I'm working miracles
 I live a life of favor,
 For I know who I am

[V5]
 [Repeat from the top]

[V6]
 Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
 I know who I am
 [Repeat]

[V7]
 I am holy,
 I am righteous oh...
 I am so rich,
 I am beautiful

[V8]
 [2x]
 I'm walking in power,
 I'm working miracles
 I live a life of favor,
 For I know who I am

[V9]
 Take a look at me. I'm a wonder
 It doesn't matter what you see now
 Can you see His glory?
 For I know who I am
 [Repeat]

[V10]
 [2x]
 Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
 I know who I am</lyrics>
