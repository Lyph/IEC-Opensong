 You tell my heart it's time to let go
 I can't be free in the bindings of this world
 You burn my soul and whisper for me
 To come back home

[C1]
   I'm letting go brave surrender
   I'm taking hold of life eternal
   On the other side I will find You
   Leaving my fears behind - brave surrender

[V2]
 Choosing to believe for a freedom unknown
 Falling to my knees I can't win this on my own
 Hope is alive You've given me new eyes
 To see like You

[B1]
   I'm running, not stopping
   Straight into Your arms
   You're closer, I hear You
   Your voice cuts through the dark</lyrics>
