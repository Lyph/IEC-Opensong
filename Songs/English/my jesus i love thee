<lyrics>[V1]
.   D   G   D            A             D
 My Jesus I love Thee; I know Thou art mine.
.    D    G       D          A       D
 For Thee all the follies of sin I resign.
.   D  G     Em D    A     D-D/F#-G D   A
 My gracious Re-deemer, my Savior   art Thou.
.   D G    D-D/G# Bm       Em-A        D
 If ever I loved  Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

[V2]
 I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me
 And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree.
 I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow.
 If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

[V3]
.     E    A       E            B            E
 I'll love Thee in life; I will love Thee in death
.    E      A       E             B         E
 And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath
.    E   A        F#m   E   B    E-E/G# A  A/F# E  B
 And say when the death-dew lies cold   on my   brow
.   E A    E-E/D# C#m      F#m-B       E
 If ever I loved  Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

[V4]
 In mansions of glory and endless delight
 I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright.
 I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow.
 If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.</lyrics>
