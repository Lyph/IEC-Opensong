<lyrics>[V1]
 We have had enough of getting everything we want
 We are weary of living this life just for us
 Oh forgive us of seeking Your hand and not Your face
 Come and empty us, Father, we're desperate in this place

[C1]
   CHORUS:
   Holy Spirit
   Fill us with Your fire
   Give us Your desires
   Hold us close to You
   Holy Spirit
   Give us revelation
   A healing visitation
   Nothing else will do
   We want more and more
   And more and more of You

[V2]
 You have given us so much more than we deserve
 You deliver us by the power of Your Word
 So God we lift you up, giving You the honor that is Yours
 Thank You for Your love, Father, this is what we're living for

[V3]
 CHORUS

[V4]
 O the Love that covers us
 O the Savior's mercy
 O the blood that makes a spotless Bride
 O the Love that covers us
 O the Savior's mercy
 O the blood that makes a spotless Bride

[V5]
 CHORUS (twice)

[V6]
 We want more and more
 And more and more of You</lyrics>
