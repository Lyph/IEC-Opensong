<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus Christ is ris'n today, Alleluia! Our triumphant holy day, Alleluia! Who did once, upon the cross, Alleluia! Suffer to redeem our loss, Alleluia!

[V2]
 Hymns of praise then let us sing, Alleluia! Unto Christ, our heav'nly King, Alleluia! Who endured the cross and grave, Alleluia! Sinners to redeem and save, Alleluia!

[V3]
 But the pain which He endured, Alleluia! Our salvation hath procured, Alleluia! Now above the sky He's king, Alleluia! Where the angels ever sing, Alleluia!

[V4]
 Sing we to our God above, Alleluia! Praise eternal as His love, Alleluia! Praise Him, all you heav'nly host, Alleluia! Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Alleluia!</lyrics>
