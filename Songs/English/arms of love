<lyrics>[V1]
.G        D              Em
 I sing a simple song of love,
.      C      Em      D
 To my Saviour, to my Jesus
.G            D                     Em
 I'm grateful for the things You've done,
.          C      Em           D
 My loving Saviour, O precious Jesus

[P1]
.  Am          Em               D              G
   My heart is glad that You've called me Your own
.  Am         Em               D
   There's no place I'd rather be,

[C1]
.               G D     C
   Than in Your arms of love
.          G D     C
   In Your arms of love
.             Em     D          C
   Holding me still, holding me near,
.          D       G
   In Your arms of love</lyrics>
