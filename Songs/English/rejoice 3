<title>Rejoice</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 See the morning, see it rising
 Over the mountains high.
 See the mercy in the mighty hand of God.
 Living Water, come and fill us;
 Only You can satisfy.
 Turn our sorrow into singing
 The song of life.

[C1]
   Rejoice, rejoice,
   And sing with the angel voices!
   Rejoice, rejoice!
   All Heaven and earth, rejoice!

[V2]
 Lord, Your strength is a tower
 The righteous run into.
 Lord, Your love is a banner over us.
 And we hold on to the promise
 That Your hold on us is true.
 There's no other like You, Jesus;
 No one like You.

[B1]
   Always. Again I say rejoice
   Always. Again I say rejoice
   Always. Again I say rejoice
   Always, Always.</lyrics>
