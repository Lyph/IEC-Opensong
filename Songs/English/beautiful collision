<lyrics>[V1]
.Em7                  Cmaj7
 The breaking makes a sound
.                   Em7
 I never knew could be
.                 Cmaj7                 Em7    Cmaj7
 So beautiful and loud. Fury filled and we collide.

[V2]
.Em7                 Cmaj7                Em7
 So courageous until now, fumbling and scared.
.                         Cmaj7                     G
 So afraid You'll find me out, alone here with my doubt.

[C1]
.  G        D/F#                     Am7
   Here it comes; a beautiful collision
.          Cmaj7
   Is happening now.
.  G          D/F#
   There seems no end to where you begin
.    Am7      Cmaj7       Em7     Cmaj7
   And there I am now you and I collide.

[V3]
.Em7                   Cmaj7
 Something circling inside.
.               Em7
 Spaciously you fly,
.             Cmaj7                   Em7   Cmaj7
 Infinite and wide. Like the moon and sky collide.

[B1]
.                   Em7
   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
.          Cmaj7                         Em7
   Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes now. (3X)

[B2]
.  Cmaj7
   Collide...
.  Em7                     Cmaj7              Em7
   Here it comes, here it comes now, You and I (2X)
.          Em7                           Cmaj7
   Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes now.
.                 Em7               Cmaj7
   Feel it comin' on, feel it comin' on.
   Here it comes now, here it comes,
.                                  Em7 Cmaj7
   Here it comes, here it comes now.</lyrics>
