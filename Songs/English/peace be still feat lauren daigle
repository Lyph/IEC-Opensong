 I don't want to be afraid every time I face the waves
 I don't want to be afraid, I don't want to be afraid
 I don't want to fear the storm just because I hear the roar
 I don't want to fear the storm, I don't want to fear the storm

[C1]
   Peace be still say the word and I will
   Set my feet upon the sea, till I'm dancing in the deep
   Peace be still You are here so it is well
   Even when my eyes can't see, I will trust the voice that speaks

[V2]
 I'm not gonna be afraid 'cause these waves are only waves
 I'm not gonna be afraid, I'm not gonna be afraid
 I'm not gonna fear the storm You are greater than it's roar
 I'm not gonna fear the storm I'm not gonna fear at all

[C2]
   Peace be still say the word and I will
   Set my feet upon the sea, till I'm dancing in the deep
   Peace be still You are here so it is well
   Even when my eyes can't see, I will trust the voice that speaks

[V3]
 Peace, peace over me

[B1]
   Let faith, rise up oh heart, Believe, let faith rise up in me
   Let faith, rise up oh heart, Believe, let faith rise up in me
   Let faith, rise up oh heart, Believe let faith rise up in me
   Let faith, rise up oh heart, Believe let faith rise up in me

[C3]
   Peace be still say the word and I will
   Set my feet upon the sea, till I'm dancing in the deep
   Peace be still You are here so it is well
   Even when my eyes can't see, I will trust the voice that speaks

[V4]
 Peace, peace over me
 Peace, peace over me

[B2]
   Let faith, rise up oh heart, Believe, let faith rise up in me
   Let faith, rise up oh heart, Believe, let faith rise up in me
   Let faith, rise up oh heart, Believe let faith rise up in me
   Let faith, rise up oh heart, Believe let faith rise up in me

[C4]
   Peace be still say the word and I will
   Set my feet upon the sea, till I'm dancing in the deep
   Peace be still You are here so it is well
   Even when my eyes can't see, I will trust the voice that speaks
