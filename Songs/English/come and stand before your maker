<title>Come and stand before your maker</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Come and stand before your maker
 Full of wonder, full of fear;
 Come behold his power and glory
 Yet with confidence draw near,
 For the one who holds the heavens
 And commands the stars above
 Is the God who bends to bless us
 With an unrelenting love.

[C1]
   Rejoice!
   Come and lift your hands and raise your voice;
   He is worthy of all praise,
   Rejoice!
   Sing the mercies of your King
   And with trembling, rejoice.

[V2]
 We are children of the promise,
 The beloved of the Lord.
 Won with everlasting kindness,
 Bought with sacrificial blood.
 Bringing reconciliation
 To a world that longs to know
 The affections of a father
 Who will never let them go.

[V3]
 All our sickness, all our sorrows
 Jesus carried up the hill.
 He has walked this path before us,
 He is walking with us still;
 Turning tragedy to triumph,
 Turning agony to praise,
 There is blessing in the battle
 So take heart and stand amazed.</lyrics>
