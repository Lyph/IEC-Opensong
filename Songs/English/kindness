<lyrics>[V1]
.G    G/F#   Em7      Dsus
 Open up the skies of mercy.
.G    G/F#     Em7
 Rain down the cleansing flood.
.G       G/F#   Em7   Dsus
 Healing waters rise around us.
.C2                  Dsus
 Hear our cries, Lord; let 'em rise.

[C1]
.            C         G          Am7
   It's Your kindness, Lord, that leads us to repentance.
.         C    G              Am7
   Your favor, Lord, is our desire.
.            C       G          Am7
   It's Your beauty, Lord, that makes us stand in silence
.      C                                   G
   And Your love, Your love is better than life.

[V2]
 We can feeel Your mercy falling.
 You are turning our hearts back again.
 Hear our praises rise to heaven.
 Draw us near, Lord, meet us here.</lyrics>
