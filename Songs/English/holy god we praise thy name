<lyrics>[V1]
 Holy God, we praise Thy Name; Lord of all, we bow before Thee! All on earth Thy scepter claim, All in Heaven above adore Thee; Infinite Thy vast domain, Everlasting is Thy reign.

[V2]
 Hark! the loud celestial hymn Angel choirs above are raising, Cherubim and seraphim, In unceasing chorus praising; Fill the heavens with sweet accord: Holy, holy, holy, Lord.

[V3]
 Lo! the apostolic train Join the sacred Name to hallow; Prophets swell the loud refrain, And the white robed martyrs follow; And from morn to set of sun, Through the Church the song goes on.

[V4]
 Holy Father, Holy Son, Holy Spirit, Three we name Thee; While in essence only One, Undivided God we claim Thee; And adoring bend the knee, While we own the mystery.</lyrics>
