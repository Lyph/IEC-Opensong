<lyrics>[V1]
 Come down, O love divine, seek Thou this soul of mine, And visit it with Thine own ardor glowing. O Comforter, draw near, within my heart appear, And kindle it, Thy holy flame bestowing.

[V2]
 O let it freely burn, til earthly passions turn To dust and ashes in its heat consuming; And let Thy glorious light shine ever on my sight, And clothe me round, the while my path illuming.

[V3]
 Let holy charity mine outward vesture be, And lowliness become mine inner clothing; True lowliness of heart, which takes the humbler part, And o'er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.

[V4]
 And so the yearning strong, with which the soul will long, Shall far outpass the pow'r of human telling; For none can guess its grace, till he become the place Wherein the Holy Spirit makes His dwelling.</lyrics>
