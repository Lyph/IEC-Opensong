<lyrics>[V1]
 In the presence of Your people
 I will praise Your Name
 for alone You are holy,
 enthroned on the praises of Israel.
 Let us celebrate Your goodness
 and Your steadfast love;
 may Your Name be exalted
 here on earth and in heaven above

[V2]
 All who love You sing Your praises
 and proclaim Your power,
 for alone You are holy,
 enthroned on the praises of Israel.
 You have not ignored our suffering
 but have heard our cry;
 may Your power be exalted
 here on earth and in heaven above

[V3]
 All who seek Your rule will praise You
 and be satisfied;
 for alone You are holy,
 enthroned on the praises of Israel.
 All the peoples of the nations
 will bow down to You;
 may Your rule be exalted
 here on earth and in heaven above</lyrics>
