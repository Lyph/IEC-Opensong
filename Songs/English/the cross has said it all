 The cross has said it all,
 The cross has said it all.
 I can't deny what You have shown,
 The cross speaks of a God of love;
 there displayed for all to see,
 Jesus Christ, our only hope,
 a message of the Father's heart:
 &quot;Come, my children, come on home.&quot;

[V2]
 As high as the heavens are above the earth,
 so high is the measure of Your great love;
 as far as the east is from the west,
 so far have You taken our sins from us

[V3]
 The cross has said it all,
 the cross has said it all.
 I never recognized Your touch
 until I met You at the cross.
 We are fallen, dust to dust;
 how could You do this for us?
 son of God shed precious blood;
 who can comprehend this love?

[V4]
 How high, how wide, how deep (x2)
 How high!</lyrics>
