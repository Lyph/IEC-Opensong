 I have been redeemed
 I've been set free
 Pulled from the sea
 And You came
 And brought me in
 Defeated my sin
 And called me Your friend

[V2]
 Now I'm alive in You God
 I'm in the family now
 I'm satisfied in You God
 Your love is everything

[V3]
 You've broken every chain
 I'm made alive again
 And I'm living for Your glory

[V4]
 No longer slave to sin and death
 You stepped right down into my mess
 He ransomed me and paid my debts
 And clothed me in His righteousness

[V5]
 My sin does not belong to me
 The King of Love has set me free
 He's taken off my filthy rags
 And brought me in the family</lyrics>
