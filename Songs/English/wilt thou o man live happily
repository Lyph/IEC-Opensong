<lyrics>[V1]
 Wilt thou, O man, live happily, And dwell with God eternally, The ten commandments keep, for thus Our God Himself biddeth us. Kyr' eleison!

[V2]
 I am the Lord and God! take heed No other god doth thee mislead; Thy heart shall trust alone in Me, My kingdom then thou shalt be.

[V3]
 Honor My Name in word and deed, And call on Me in time of need: Hallow the Sabbath, that I may Work in thy heart on that day.

[V4]
 Obedient always, next to Me, To father and to mother be; Kill no man: even anger dread; Keep sacred thy marriage bed.

[V5]
 Steal not, nor do thy neighbor wrong By bearing witness with false tongue; Thy neighbor's wife desire thou not, Nor grudge him aught he hath got.</lyrics>
