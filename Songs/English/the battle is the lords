<lyrics>[V1]
.F#m
 When the mighty men
 From the tribe of Judah
. D           Bm
 Faced the enemy
.           F#m
 They were told by God
 Not to be afraid
.           D       A    D
 He would give the victory
.Bm                C#m
 He said lift up a song
.                   D
 And lay down the sword
.Bm                 C#m
 For the battle is mine
.          A  E
 Says the Lord

[V2]
.A              F#m
 Sing unto the Lord
.               G
 Make a joyful sound
 Lift your voices
.     D         E        A
 And let your praise resound
.A               F#m
 Sing a victory song
.                G
 In the time of war
 Trust in Jesus
.     Bm     E       A
 The battle is the LordÂ´s

[V3]
 When the evil one
 Comes against you
 To fill yor heart with fear
 You can trust in God
 He wil never leave you
 He promised to be near
 You can lift up a song
 In the midst of the war
 For the battle is mine
 Says the Lord

[V4]
