 Verse 1:
 Wish it could be easy
 Why is life so messy?
 Why is pain a part of us?
 There are days I feel like
 Nothing ever goes right
 Sometimes it just hurts so much

[V2]
 But You're here
 You're real
 I know I can trust You

[C1]
   Chorus:
   Even when it hurts
   Even when it's hard
   Even when it all just falls apart
   I will run to You
   'Cause I know that You are
   Lover of my soul
   Healer of my scars

[V3]
 You steady my heart
 You steady my heart

[V4]
 Verse 2:
 I'm not gonna worry
 I know that You've got me
 Right inside the palm of your hand
 Each and every moment
 What's good and what gets broken
 Happens just the way You plan

[V5]
 You are here
 You're real
 I know I can trust You

[C2]
   Chorus:
   Even when it hurts
   Even when it's hard
   Even when it all just falls apart
   I will run to You
   'Cause I know that You are
   Lover of my soul
   Healer of my scars

[V6]
 You steady my heart
 You steady my heart

[B1]
   Bridge:
   And I will run to You
   And find refuge in Your arms
   And I will sing to You
   'Cause of everything You are

[V7]
 Choruse:
 You steady my heart
 You steady my heart
 Even when it hurts
 Even when it's hard
 Even when it all just falls apart
 I will run to You
 'Cause I know that You are
 Lover of my soul
 Healer of my scars

[V8]
 You steady my heart
 You steady my heart

[V9]
 I'm not gonna worry
 I know that you've got me
 Right inside the palm of your hand</lyrics>
