<lyrics>[V1]
.F               C                       F
 I have this hope as an anchor for my soul
 I'm sure that steadfast hope is an anchor for my soul

[V2]
.       Dm                   C
 There's no other way for a man
.     C                       G
 to dwell in the presence of God
 there's no other way to please Him
 but by faith in what He's done

[V3]
.              Am                 G
 There's only one way for me to come
.          C                 F
 into a precense of divine love
 and it's believing that i am washed
 and enjoyed by You

[V4]
.Am                           G
 To the same measure that You love Your Son
. C                         F
 is the same way that You love me God</lyrics>
