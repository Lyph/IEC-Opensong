<lyrics>[V1]
 Breathe on me, breath of God, Fill me with life anew, That I may love what Thou dost love, And do what Thou wouldst do.

[V2]
 Breathe on me, breath of God, Until my heart is pure, Until with Thee I will one will, To do and to endure.

[V3]
 Breathe on me, breath of God, So shall I never die, But live with Thee the perfect life Of Thine eternity.</lyrics>
