<lyrics>[V1]
 Holy Spirit, ever dwelling in the holiest realms of light Holy Spirit, ever brooding o'er a world of gloom and blight Holy Spirit, ever raising earthbound souls to glory high Living, life\imparting Spirit you we praise and magnify.

[V2]
 Holy Spirit, ever breathing on the church the breath of life Holy Spirit, ever striving through your people's ceaseless strife Holy Spirit, ever forming in the church the mind of Christ In our worship we will praise you for your fruit and gifts unpriced.

[V3]
 Holy Spirit, ever working through the church's ministry Quick'ning, strength'ning, and absolving setting captive sinners free Holy Spirit, ever binding age to age and soul to soul In community unending you we worship and extol.</lyrics>
