<lyrics>[V1]
 Out of the shadows Bound for the gallows
 A dead man walking till love came calling
 Rise up (rise up) Rise up (rise up)
 Six feet under I thought it was over
 An answer to prayer the voice of a Savior
 Rise up (rise up) Rise up (rise up)

[C1]
   All at once I came alive
   This beating heart, these open eyes?
   They don't let go?
   The darkness should have known
   (You're still rolling rolling, you're still rolling rolling oh)
   You're still rolling stones (You're still rolling rolling oh)
   You're still rolling stones

[V2]
 Now that You saved me I sing 'cause You gave me
 A song of revival I put it on vinyl
 Rise up (rise up) Rise up (rise up)
 I once was blinded but now I see it
 I heard about the power and now I believe it
 Rise up (rise up) Rise up (rise up)

[B1]
   I thought that I was too far gone
   For everything I've done wrong
   Yeah, I'm the one who dug this grave
   But You called my name
   You called my name
   I thought that I was too far gone
   For everything I've done wrong
   Yeah, I'm the one who dug this grave
   But You called my name
   You called my name</lyrics>
