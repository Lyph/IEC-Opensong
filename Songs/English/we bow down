.        C          F         G          C
 You are Lord of creation and Lord of my life,
.                         G
 Lord of the land and the sea;
.         C           F         G              Am
 You were Lord of the heavens before there was time,
.    F           G              C
 And Lord of all Lords You will be.

[C1]
.         C   F       G           C
   We bow down and we worship You Lord,
.         C   F       G           C
   We bow down and we worship You Lord,
.         C   F       G           Am
   We bow down and we worship You Lord,
.  F           G              C
   Lord of all Lords You will be.

.        C          F         G          C
 You are King of creation and King of my life,
.                         G
 King of the land and the sea;
.         C           F         G              Am
 You were King of the heavens before there was time,
.    F           G              C
 And King of all Kings You will be.</lyrics>
