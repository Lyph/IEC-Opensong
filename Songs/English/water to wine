<title>Water To Wine</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Words and Music by Joel Houston

[V2]
 VERSE 1
 Everlasting
 So infinite in wildest love
 My soul thirsts for the things above
 Turn this water into wine

[V3]
 VERSE 2
 Blood and water
 The mercy flowing from Your side
 A river made of endless light
 When my heart was running dry

[V4]
 CHORUS 1
 So I'll stay
 Stay in Your love
 As long as life within me I'll remain
 In who You are Lord

[V5]
 VERSE 3
 Take this wineskin
 My spirit bursts for something new
 There's nothing I want more than You
 Only You can satisfy

[V6]
 CHORUS 2
 So I'll stay
 I'll stay in Your love
 As long as life within me
 I'll remain
 In who You are Lord

[V7]
 So I'll stay
 Stay in Your love
 In the vintage of Your heart
 Lord only You could satisfy me

[V8]
 So I'll stay
 Fixed within Your life
 A branch within Your vine
 Apart from You Lord I've got nothing
 So I'll stay
 I will stay within Your hold
 I know You'll never let me go
 And my soul it runs with mercy

[V9]
 So I'll stay
 Stay in Your love
 I'll stay where You are
 As long as life remains

[V10]
 So I'll stay
 Stay with You
 I'll never walk away
 I'll never be the same
 Turn this water into wine
 I know You love me Lord
 I know You love me Lord
 I know You love me Lord
 I know You love me Lord

[V11]
 Let Your Spirit transform my soul
 Your Spirit awakens me
 Your Spirit sets me free
 And for all I'm yet to know

[V12]
 I know You'll never let me go
 I know You love me
 I know You love me so
 I know what love means
 It's who You are</lyrics>
