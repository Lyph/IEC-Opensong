<lyrics>[V1]
.         A                 B       C#m
 I've had questions without answers.
.A                  C#m          B
 I've known sorrow. I have known pain.
.A                    B          C#m
 But there's one thing that I'll cling to:
.A                 C#m           B
 You are faithful. Jesus, You're true.

[C1]
.  A
   When hope is lost,
.  E             B      A
   I'll call You Savior.
.       A               E             B      A
   When pain surrounds, I'll call You Healer.
.  A                   E             B              C#m
   When silence falls, You'll be the song within my heart.

[V2]
.       A        B      C#m
 In the lone hour of my sorrow,
.A                   C#m         B
 Through the darkest night of my soul,
.A              B            C#m
 You surround me and sustain me,
.A            C#m    B
 My Defender, forevermore.

[B1]
.  A                     B       E          A
   And I will praise You, I will praise You.
.  A                    B            E           A
   When the tears fall, still I will sing to You.
.  A                     B       E          A
   And I will praise You, Jesus, praise You.
.  A                     B             E    A
   Through the suffering, still I will sing.</lyrics>
