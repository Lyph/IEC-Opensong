<lyrics>[V1]
 Who, oh Lord, could save themselves
 Their own soul could heal
 Our shame was deeper than the sea
 Your grace is deeper still

[C1]
   You alone can rescue, You alone can save
   You alone can lift us from the grave
   You came down to find us, led us out of death
   To You alone belongs the highest praise

[V2]
 You, oh Lord, have made a way
 The great divide You healed
 For when our hearts were far away
 Your love went further still
 (yes Your love goes further still)

[B1]
   We lift up our eyes, lift up our eyes
   You're the Giver of Life
