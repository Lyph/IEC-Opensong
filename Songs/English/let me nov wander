<lyrics>[V1]
 Verse:
 With my whole heart i have sought You
 With my whole heart
 With my whole heart i have sought You
 With my whole heart

[C1]
   Chorus:
   Let me not wander from Your commandments
   Let me not wander from Your word
   For Your word I've hidden in my heart
   That I might not sin against You

[B1]
   Bridge:
   Blessed are You Lord in all of Your ways
   I open up my mouth, declare Your praise
   I will meditate on Your word and I will not forget
   I will not forget  Your promises to me</lyrics>
