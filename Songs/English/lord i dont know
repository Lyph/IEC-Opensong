<lyrics>[V1]
.Em          G         D
 You are the author of knowledge.
.Em        G                D
 You can redeem what's been done.
.Em           G           D             C
 You hold the present and all that's to come
 Until your everlasting kingdom.

[C1]
.  G               D         Am            C
    Lord, I don't know where all this is going,
.            G         D
   or how it all works out.
.  G           D             Am             C
    Lead me to peace that is past understanding,
.            G        D
   a peace beyond all doubt.

[V2]
.Em          G        D
 You are the God of tomorrow,
.Em          G           D
 Turning the darkness to dawn,
.Em          G             D          C
 Lifting the hopeless with hope to go on.
 You are the Rock of all salvation.

[B1]
.      C
   Oh, Lord, you are the author,
.    G                   D
   Redeeming what's been done.
.      C
   You hold us in the present
.      G              D
   And all that is to come. (2X)

[B2]
.  G               D          Am            C
    Lord, we don't know where all this is going,
.            G         D
   or how it all works out.
.  G           D             Am             C
    Lead us to peace that is past understanding,
.            G        D
   a peace beyond all doubt.</lyrics>
