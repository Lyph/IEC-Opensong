 All praise to Thee, my God, this night, For all the blessings of the light! Keep me, O keep me, King of kings, Beneath Thine own almighty wings.

[V2]
 Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son, The ill that I this day have done, That with the world, myself, and Thee, I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

[V3]
 Teach me to live, that I may dread The grave as little as my bed. Teach me to die, that so I may Rise glorious at the judgment day.

[V4]
 O may my soul on Thee repose, And with sweet sleep mine eyelids close, Sleep that may me more vig'rous make To serve my God when I awake.

[V5]
 When in the night I sleepless lie, My soul with heav'nly thoughts supply; Let no ill dreams disturb my rest, No pow'rs of darkness me molest.

[V6]
 O when shall I, in endless day,
 For ever chase dark sleep away,
 And hymns divine with angels sing,
 All praise to thee, eternal King?

[V7]
 Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow;
 Praise Him, all creatures here below;
 Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;
 Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</lyrics>
