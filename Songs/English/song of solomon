<title>Song of Solomon</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Verse:
 When I feel the cold of winter
 And this cloak of sadness
 I need You
 All the evil things that shake me
 All the words that break me
 I need You

[C1]
   Chorus:
   Over the mountains
   Over the sea
   Here You come running
   My Lover to me

[V2]
 Verse:
 Do not hide me from Your presence
 Pull me from these shadows
 I need You
 Beauty wrap Your arms around me
 Sing Your song of kindness
 I need You

[B1]
   Bridge:
   Oh through the valleys
   Through the dark of night
   Here You come running
   To hold me until it's light

[C2]
   Refrain:
   I'll come running
   I'll come running
   I'll come running
   Back to You</lyrics>
