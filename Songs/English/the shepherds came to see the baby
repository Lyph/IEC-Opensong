 The shepherds came to, see the baby,
 Stood by his mothers side
 Here laid the Savior, inside a manger
 O what a glorious night
 O what a glorious night

[C1]
   I hear the angels singing, hallelujah
   Let the Earth receive her King
   I know that love has come, sing it out
   Jesus Christ is born
   Jesus Christ is born

[V2]
 The shepherds wonder, they couldnt hide it, told everyone in sight
 All were amazed when, they heard how God came
 Down on this glorious night
 God came down on this glorious night

[B1]
   Glo-orious, glo-orious, What a glorious night!
   Glo-orious, glo-orious, What a glorious night!

[V3]
 All is calm now, all is quiet,
 A star shining in the sky
 Below in Bethlehem,
 The King is sleeping
 Oh what a glorious night
 Oh what a glorious night</lyrics>
