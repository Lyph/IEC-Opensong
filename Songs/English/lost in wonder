<lyrics>[V1]
 Father
 You're the author of creation
 You're the joy of every nation
 There is none like You

[V2]
 Jesus
 You display the Father's glory
 You're the centre of the story
 There is none like You

[V3]
 So I fall down at Your feet
 Lost in wonder, worshipping
 Praises to the most high king
 I give you all of my affection Lord
 You're my everything
 Jesus You're my everything
 Take all the world just give me Jesus

[V4]
 Messiah
 You're the stillness in the wrestling
 You're the answer to my questions
 I'm in awe of You

[V5]
 Saviour
 You gave up your life to save us
 Day by day you recreate us
 I'm in awe of You</lyrics>
