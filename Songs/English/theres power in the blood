<lyrics>[V1]
 Would you be free from the burden of sin?
 There's power in the blood, power in the blood
 Would you o'er evil a victory win?
 There's wonderful power in the blood

[C1]
   There is power, power, wonder-working power
   In the blood of the Lamb
   There is power, power, wonder-working power
   In the precious blood of the Lamb

[V2]
 Would you be free from your passion and pride
 There's power in the blood, power in the blood
 Come for a cleansing to Calvary's tide
 There's wonderful power in the blood

[V3]
 There is power, power, wonder-working power
 In the blood of the Lamb
 There is power, power, wonder-working power
 In the precious blood of the Lamb

[V4]
 Would you be whiter,
 much whiter than snow?
 There's power in the blood, power in the blood
 Sin stains are lost in its life-giving flow
 There's wonderful power in the blood

[V5]
 There is power, power, wonder-working power
 In the blood of the Lamb
 There is power, power, wonder-working power
 In the precious blood of the Lamb

[V6]
 There is power, power, wonder-working power
 In the blood of the Lamb
 There is power, power, wonder-working power
 In the precious blood of the Lamb</lyrics>
