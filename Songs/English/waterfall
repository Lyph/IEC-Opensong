 [Verse 1]
 Oh God, my God I seek You
 I wanna move when You move
 You're more than I could long for
 I thirst for You

[V2]
 [Chorus]
 You're an ocean to my soul
 To my soul
 Your love is like a waterfall, waterfall
 Running wild and free
 You hear my heart when I call, when I call
 Deep calls, too deep
 Your love is like a waterfall, waterfall
 Raining down on me

[V3]
 [Verse 2]
 Waterfall, waterfall
 Oh God, my God I seek You
 In this dry and desert land
 You lead me to streams of mercy
 Once again

[V4]
 [Chorus]

[V5]
 [Bridge]
 Waterfall, waterfall
 It's coming like a flood
 I'm dancing in the rain
 Everything I've done
 Is covered in rivers of grace, amazing
 It's coming like a flood
 I'm dancing in the rain
 I lift up my hands
 Your love never changes, amazing</lyrics>
