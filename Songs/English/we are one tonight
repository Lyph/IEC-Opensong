<lyrics>[V1]
.G         D
 All rise, all fall.
.Em7      C2
 I'll fail you all.
.G                    D
 We built these cities to stand so tall.
.Em7          C2
 We've lost our walls.

[P1]
.  D               Em7              C2
   I don't want to lose you, coming down,
   With the whole world upside-down.
.  D              Em7              C2
   I don't have a soul to trust in now,
   With the whole world upside-down.

[C1]
.  G      D      Em7
   We are one, tonight!
.            C2
   And we're singing it out!
.  G      D      Em7
   We are one, tonight!
.            C2
   And we're dreaming out loud!
.  G          D        Em7
   Though the world is flawed,
.        C2
   These scars will heal.
.  G      D      Em7
   We are one, tonight!
.  C2
   Tonight!
.  G       DEm7C2
   Tonight!

[V2]
.G         D
 Two eyes, one tongue.
.Em7       C2
 I've come undone.
.G              D
 I'm no victim, I've paid these dues.
.Em7       C2
 I came to lose.

[P2]
.  D               Em7            C2
   I don't want to fight about it now,
   With the whole world upside-down.
.  D              Em7               C2
   I don't have a soul to trust in, now,
   With the whole world upside-down.

[B1]
.  D               Em7                C2
   I don't want to lose the common ground,
   With the whole world upside-down.
.  D               Em7               C2
   I don't want to fight about it now,
   In a world that's burning out.
.                         G
   Let's slow the evening down.
.          D
   Slow it down.
.       Em7  C2
   Slow down.
.              G
   Please slow down,
.  D         Em7
   Down, down.
.      C2
   The stars are comin' out!</lyrics>
