<lyrics>[V1]
 I used to think that I could walk on this road alone
 That I had the strength- mmmm- to carry on
 And I could be somebody if I really tried
 The power that I needed was hidden inside

[P1]
   But then I saw myself for who I really was.
   I saw my emptiness- I saw I needed help
   But then I saw myself for I was really was

[C1]
   But now that I'm with you my life is beautiful
   And now that I'm with you my life is so wonderful
   You've given me the strength I need to carry on
   In the hard times and low times
   With you my God I'll get through

[V2]
 I used to live my life just to seize the day
 Do everything I could to be self-made
 And pride was all I needed, no one else around
 My happiness and joy was what I thought I found

[P2]
   But then I saw myself for who I really was.
   I saw my emptiness- I saw I needed help
   But then I saw myself for I was really was

[C2]
   But now that I'm with you my life is beautiful
   And now that I'm with you my life is so wonderful
   You've given me the strength I need to carry on
   In the hard times and low times
   With you my God I'll get through

[B1]
   I've been created for you Lord
   I've been put here by your Word
   I'm nothing, without You
   Without Your love I can't go on
   By Your touch my life was born
   You knew me all along

[P3]
   And now I see myself For who I'm meant to be
   A child of God I am In your hands I'll be
   And now I see myself For who I'm meant to be

[C3]
   But now that I'm with you my life is beautiful
   And now that I'm with you my life is so wonderful
   You've given me the strength I need to carry on
   In the hard times and low times
   With you my God I'll get through</lyrics>
