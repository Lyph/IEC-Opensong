.C2  G  D  C2  G  D
  
.C               G                D
 Higher than the mountains that I face
.C                 G            D
 Stronger than the power of the grave
.C                    G             D
 Constant through the trial and the change
.    C     G       D
 One thing remains

[C1]
.          Em7               C
   // Your love never fails, never gives up
.  G                 D
   Never runs out on me  //

[V2]
.C             G            D
 On and on and on and on it goes
.   C              G            D
 It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
.      C            G          D
 And I never, ever, have to be afraid
.    C     G  D
 One thing re-mains
.    C     G  D
 One thing re-mains

[B1]
.     C         G         D
   In death, In life, I'm confident and
.  Amaj7          C        G          D
   covered by the power of Your great love
.     C       G
   My debt is paid
.          D
   There's nothing that can
.  Amaj7       C
   separate my heart
.       G          D
   from Your great love
