[V2]
 VERSE 1
 Everything starts in You
 Made to be beautiful
 Nothing could tear Your heart
 From the covenant You made for love

[V3]
 VERSE 2
 Everything moves in time
 Played into Your design
 Nothing could tear Your heart
 From the world You died to save

[V4]
 CHORUS 1
 You fall like rain
 In fire and thunder
 The mountains melt
 Like wax before You

[V5]
 VERSE 3
 Everything finds its place
 Folding beneath Your ways
 Nothing could stand against
 Your resurrected Name

[V6]
 CHORUS 2
 You fall like rain
 In fire and thunder
 The mountains melt
 Like wax before You
 Your kingdom reigns
 In everlasting grace and wonder
 Your love making all things new
 Your love making everything beautiful

[V7]
 BRIDGE 1
 My God
 Making all things new
 Everything turning
 From ruin to life in You
 Making all things new
 Everything turning to something so beautiful

[V8]
 BRIDGE 2
 Your goodness
 Your mercy
 Your promise crashing down like rain
 Your kingdom
 Your glory
 Your presence breaking out like rain

[V9]
 VERSE 4
 Everything ends in praise
 Shining in Your embrace
 Nothing could tear Your heart
 From the promise that remains</lyrics>
