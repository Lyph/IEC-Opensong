<lyrics>[V1]
 Holy Ghost, with light divine Shine upon this heart of mine; Chase the shades of night away, Turn the darkness into day.

[V2]
 Let me see my Savior's face, Let me all His beauties trace; Show those glorious truths to me Which are only known to Thee.

[V3]
 Holy Ghost, with pow'r divine Cleanse this guilty heart of mine; In Thy mercy pity me, From sin's bondage set me free.

[V4]
 Holy Ghost, with joy divine Cheer this saddened heart of mine; Yield a sacred, settled peace, Let it grow and still increase.

[V5]
 Holy Spirit, all divine, Dwell within this heart of mine; Cast down every idol\throne, Reign supreme, and reign alone.

[V6]
 See, to Thee I yield my heart,
 Shed Thy life through every part;
 A pure temple I would be,
 Wholly dedicate to Thee.

[V7]
 Holy Spirit, Truth divine,
 Dawn upon this soul of mine;
 Word of God and inward light
 Wake my spirit, clear my sight.

[V8]
 Holy Spirit, Love divine,
 Glow within this heart of mine;
 Kindle every high desire;
 Perish self in Thy pure fire.

[V9]
 Holy Spirit, Power divine
 Fill and nerve this will of mine;
 Grant that I may strongly live,
 Bravely bear, and nobly strive.

[V10]
 Holy Spirit, Right divine,
 King within my conscience reign;
 Be my Lord, and I shall be
 Firmly bound, forever free.

[V11]
 Holy Spirit, Peace divine,
 Still this restless heart of mine;
 Speak to calm this tossing sea,
 Stayed in Thy tranquility.

[V12]
 Holy Spirit, Joy divine,
 Gladden Thou this heart of mine;
 In the desert ways I sing,
 &quot;Spring, O Well, forever spring.&quot;

[V13]
 Now incline me to repent,
 Let me now my sins lament,
 Now my foul revolt deplore,
 Weep, believe, and sin no more.</lyrics>
