<lyrics>[V1]
 In peace and joy I now depart At God's disposing; For full of comfort is my heart, Soft reposing. So the Lord hath promised me, And death is but a slumber.

[V2]
 'Tis Christ that wrought this work for me, My faithful Savior, Whom Thou hast made mine eyes to see By Thy favor. Now I know He is my Life, My Help in need and dying.

[V3]
 Him Thou hast unto all set forth Their great Salvation And to His kingdom called the earth, Every nation, By Thy dear and wholesome Word, In every place resounding.

[V4]
 He is the Hope and saving Light Of lands benighted; By Him are they who dwelt in night Fed and lighted. He is Israel's Praise and Bliss, Their Joy, Reward, and Glory.</lyrics>
