<lyrics>[V1]
.G                    C2
 I once was fatherless, a stranger with no hope.
.G                           C2
 Your kindness wakened me, wakened me from my sleep.
.G                          C2
 Your love it beckons deeply, a call to come and die.
.G
 By grace now I will come
.    C2
 and take this life, take Your life.

[P1]
.  Em7                     D
   Sin has lost its power. Death has lost its sting.
.  Em7                          C
   From the grave You've risen, victoriously!

[C1]
.  G
   Into marvelous light I'm running,
.  C2
   Out of darkness, out of shame.
.  Em7                D
   By the cross, You are the Truth,
.      C2                            GGsus
   You are the Life, You are the Way.

[V2]
.G                           C2
 My dead heart now is beating, my deepest stains now clean.
.G                            C2
 Your breath fills up my lungs. Now I'm free! Now I'm free! (2X)

[B1]
.  G
   Lift my hands and spin around!
.  C2
   See the light that I have found!
.  Em7      Dsus             C2
   Oh the marvelous light, marvelous light!</lyrics>
