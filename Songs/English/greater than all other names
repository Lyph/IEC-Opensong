 [Verse 1]
.  A          E/G#
 Your love outlasts the   deepest pain

 Your  arms still reach the furthest place
.  D               F#m              E
 Your light still shines to  light up the darkest night

[V2]
 [Verse 2]
.   A      E/G#
 Though waters rise be yond the shore
.   D/F#   F#m         E
 Though  mountains  fall, still I am Yours

 Your name is still great
.    F#m               E
 Still greater than all other names

 You are more than enough

 You are all that You said You will be

 Through the power of the  cross I am free
