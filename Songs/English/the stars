<lyrics>[V1]
.D
 Maybe I've been the problem.
.      G              D
 Maybe I'm the one to blame.
.                C               G
 But even when I turn it off and blame myself,
.    A                 A7
 The outcome feels the same.
.                         D
 I've been thinking maybe I've been partly cloudy.
.      G                 D
 Maybe I'm the chance of rain.
.              C
 And maybe I'm overcast,
.    G            A                      A7
 And maybe all my luck's washed down the drain.

[P1]
.                           G
   I've been thinking 'bout everyone,
.  A                  Bm       C
   Everyone you look so lonely.

[C1]
.                         D
   But when I look at the stars,
.                     G
   When I look at the stars,
.                     C   A                D    G
   When I look at the stars, I see someone else.
.                     D
   When I look at the stars,
.      G   A                   D A
   The stars, I feel like myself.

.D
 Stars looking at a planet,
.         G           D
 Watching entropy and pain,
.                   C
 And maybe start to wonder
.        G            A                   A7
 How the chaos in our lives could pass as sane.
.                             D
 I've been thinking 'bout the meaning of resistance,
.     G               D
 Of a hope beyond our own,
.                 C            G
 And suddenly the infinite and penitent
.    A              A7
 Begin to look like home.

[B1]
.  G         A              Bm        D
   Everyone, everyone feels so lonely.
.  G              A              Bm       G
   Everyone, yeah everyone feels so empty.
.                     D
   When I look at the stars,
.                     G
   When I look at the stars,
.                     C    A             D      G
   When I look at the stars, I feel like myself.
.                     D
   When I look at the stars,
.      G   A        D
   The stars, I see someone...</lyrics>
