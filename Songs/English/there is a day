 There is a day that all creation's waiting for,
 A day of freedom and liberation for the earth.
 And on that day
 The Lord will come to meet His bride,
 And when we see Him
 In an instant we'll be changed.

[V2]
 The trumpet sounds
 And the dead will then be raised
 By His power never to perish again.
 Once only flesh,
 Now clothed with immortality;
 Death has now been swallowed up in victory.

[V3]
 We will meet Him in the air
 And then we will be like Him,
 For we will see Him, as He is, Oh yeah!
 Then all hurt and pain will cease,
 And we'll be with Him forever,
 And in His glory we will live,
 Oh yeah, oh yeah!</lyrics>
