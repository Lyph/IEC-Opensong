<lyrics>[V1]
.      Em                   Cmaj7
 Is it true today that when people pray
.          Em                          Cmaj7
 cloudless skies will break, kings and queens will shake?
.          D             C
 Yes, it's true, and I believe it:
.               G   D/F#Em7C
 I'm living for You.

[V2]
.      Em                    Cmaj7
 Is it true today, that when people pray
.          Em                     Cmaj7
 we'll see dead men rise, and the blind set free?
.          D             C
 Yes, it's true, and I believe it:
.               G   D/F#        Em7 C
 I'm living for You, living for You.

[C1]
.  G                      Em            C
   I'm gonna be a history maker in this land,
.  G                         Em              C
   I'm gonna be a speaker of truth to all mankind;
.  G            D/F# Em           C          G   D/F#
   I'm gonna stand,  I'm gonna run into Your arms,
.            Em    C
   Into Your arms again,
.            G   D/F#        Em    C
   Into Your arms, into Your arms again.

[V3]
.      Em                    Cmaj7
 Is it true today, that when people stand
.         Em                  Cmaj7
 with the fire of God and the truth in hand,
.          Em                  Cmaj7
 We'll see miracles, we'll see angels sing,
.          Em                   Cmaj7
 we'll see broken hearts making history?
.          D             C
 Yes, it's true, and I believe it,
.               G   D/F#        Em7 C
 I'm living for You, living for You.</lyrics>
