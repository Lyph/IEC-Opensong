<lyrics>[V1]
 The Lord reigns, the Lord reigns,
 The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice,
 Let the earth rejoice, let the earth rejoice
 Let the people be glad that our God reigns.

[V2]
 A fire goes before Him
 And burns up all His enemies
 The hills melt like wax
 At the presence of the Lord,
 At the presence of the Lord.
 The heavens declare His righteousness,
 The people see His glory;
 For You, O Lord, are exalted over all the earth,
 Over all the earth.

[V3]
 Our God reigns.
 Our God reigns,
 Our God reigns!</lyrics>
