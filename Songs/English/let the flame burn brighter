 We'll walk the land with hearts on fire,

 And every step will be a prayer.

 Sound of singing fills the air.

 Two thousand years, and still the flame

 Hearts are waiting, longing, aching,

 For awakening once again.

 To lift the fallen, to save the children,
.      Em  A      D
 To fill the nation with Your song.</lyrics>
