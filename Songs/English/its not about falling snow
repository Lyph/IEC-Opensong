<lyrics>[V1]
 It's not about falling snow
 And not because my table is full.
 The Star is shining in the sincere heart ,
 And it does not depend on calendar!

[C1]
   My holiday is Christ,
   Every day I rejoice with Him!
   And even more my soul sings
   On the day of Christ's birth!

[V2]
 I will wrap my soul in love
 And I will tell everyone Who has come to the world.
 The Star used to witness about it,
 And now I will testify!

[B1]
   I'll tell the whole world
   That Child has come down from heaven.
   The sky has lean down
   So that I could meet God!</lyrics>
