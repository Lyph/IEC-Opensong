<lyrics>[V1]
.   G       D       G       A
 In Christ alone my hope is found.
.D/F#     G         Em7          D
 He is my light, my strength, my song.
.     G     D           G     A
 This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
.D/F#             G        Em7         D
 Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
.     D/F#       G          D/F#      Asus
 What heights of love, what depths of peace!
.     D/F#      G             Bm7       Asus
 When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
.   G     D       G      A
 My Comforter, my All in All:
.D/F#        G       Em7      D
 Here in the love of Christ I stand.

[V2]
.   G       D         G       A
 In Christ alone! who took on flesh,
.D/F#        G      Em7      D
 Fullness of God in helpless babe!
.     G       D        G        A
 This Gift of love and righteousness,
.D/F#           G       Em7     D
 Scorned by the ones He came to save.
.     D/F#    G        D/F#  Asus
 Till on that cross as Jesus died,
.    D/F#     G       Bm7  Asus
 The wrath of God was satisfied.
.    G     D      G       A
 For every sin on Him was laid:
.D/F#        G        Em7      D
 Here in the death of Christ I live.

[V3]
.      G      D          G    A
 There in the ground His body lay,
.D/F#         G        Em7      D
 Light of the world by darkness slain.
.     G        D        G        A
 Then bursting forth in glorious Day,
.D/F#            G        Em7   D
 Up from the the grave He rose again!
.    D/F#  G         D/F# Asus
 And as He stands in victory,
.      D/F#      G         Bm7     Asus
 Sin's curse has lost it's grip on me!
.    G    D       G     A
 For I am His and He in mine,
.D/F#            G        Em7      D
 Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

[V4]
.   G        D        G       A
 No guilt in life, no fear in death,
.D/F#        G        Em7       D
 This is the power of Christ in me!
.     G            D      G     A
 From life's first cry to final breath,
.D/F#     G        Em7  D
 Jesus commands my destiny!
.   D/F#     G        D/F#      Asus
 No power of hell, no scheme of man,
.    D/F# G        Bm7      Asus
 Can ever pluck me from His hand!
.     G    D        G        A
 Till He returns or calls me home:
.D/F#        G        Em7         D
 Here in the power of Christ I'll stand!</lyrics>
