 Who paints the skies into glorious day?
 Only the splendour of Jesus.
 Who breathes His life into fists of clay?
 Only the splendour of Jesus.
 Who shapes the valleys and brings the rain?
 Only the splendour of Jesus.
 Who makes the desert to live again?
 Only the splendour of Jesus.
 Teach every nation His marvellous ways;
 Each generation shall sing His praise.

[V2]
 He is wonderful, He is glorious,
 Clothed in righteousness, full of tenderness.
 Come and worship Him,
 He's the Prince of life,
 He will cleanse our hearts In His river of fire.

[V3]
 Who hears the cry of the barren one?
 Only the mercy of Jesus.
 Who breaks the curse of the heart of stone?
 Only the mercy of Jesus.
 Who storms the prison and sets men free,
 Only the mercy of Jesus.
 Purchasing souls for eternity?
 Only the mercy of Jesus.</lyrics>
