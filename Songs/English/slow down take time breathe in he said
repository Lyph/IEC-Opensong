<lyrics>[V1]
 Slow down, take time &quot;Breathe in,&quot; He said
 He'd reveal what's to come
 The thoughts in His mind always higher than mine
 He'll reveal all to come

[C1]
   So take courage my heart stay steadfast my soul
   He's in the waiting, He's in the waiting
   Hold onto your hope as your triumph unfolds
   He's never failing, He's never failing

[V2]
 Sing praise my soul find strength in joy
 Let His words lead you on
 Do not forget His great faithfulness
 He'll finish all He's begun

[B1]
   And You who hold the stars
   Who call them each by name
   Will surely keep Your promise to me
   That I will rise in Your victory!</lyrics>
