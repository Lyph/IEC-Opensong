<lyrics>[V1]
.Am                 F     Am
 Tears have fallen. Water beads.
.                    Em   F
 Wipe the floor with my regrets.
.Am              F    Am
 In the crevice, tiny seeds
.                    Em       F
 Spring to life from pardoned debts.
.G
 And all I have, all I have is

[C1]
.  F             C              Am
   Praises on my tongue from my heart
.          G              F
   For our God who became flesh.
.         C         Am
   For us all, unto you
.         G
   I will sing my praises,
   Sing forever.

[V2]
.Am            F   Am
 In the quiet, I lament
.               Em      F
 Every nail, my sin did buy.
.Am           F       Am
 And I wonder why you spent
.                Em      F
 Lavish blood on such as I.
.G
 When all I have, all I have is

[B1]
.  F         C                   G
   Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing,
   To sing aloud, sing aloud.
.  F          C                   G
   Oh, to the Glory of my God and King,
   To sing aloud, sing aloud. (2X)

[C2]
.  F             C              Am
   Praises on my tongue from my heart
.          G              F
   For our God who became flesh.
.         C         Am
   For us all, unto you
.         G
   I will ever sing my, ever sing my

[C3]
.  F             C              Am
   Praises on my tongue from my heart
.          G              F
   For our God who became flesh.
.         C         Am
   For us all, unto you
.         G
   I will ever sing these

[B2]
.  G
   This is the truth
.     F               C
   Of God and man and life.</lyrics>
