 Jesus is the name we worship
 Jesus is the name we trust
 He is the King above all other kings
 Let all creation stand and sing
 That Jesus is our God

 Jesus is the Father's splendour
 Jesus is the Father's joy
 He will return to reign in majesty
 And every eye at last shall see
 That Jesus is our God</lyrics>
