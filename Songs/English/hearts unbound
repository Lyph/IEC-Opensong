<lyrics>[V1]
.G                                   G/B
 Hearts unbound; we were lost, now found
.               Em7     C2
 Awakened to new life in Jesus
.G                                  G/B
 Dead in sin, but we were raised with Him;
.                Em7    C2
 The Way into the Father's favour

[P1]
.  D                   C2
    Drink it in now; every heart bow
.  D                        C2
    And let joy break through

[C1]
.             G                              Em7
   All our sin wiped out, we are welcomed now
.           Am7    Em       D
   Jesus is our greatest joy
.                G                                 Em7
   Let His name be praised, God who lives to raise
.           Am7    Em       D
   Jesus is our greatest joy

[V2]
 Death disarmed forever
 Jesus' reign will never end
 The One unrivalled
 Now the Holy Spirit
 Gives the spoils of victory
 The Father's kindness

[B1]
.  C                      G/B
   Released by Your mercy
.  C                      D
   Restored by Your grace
.  C                          G/B
   Refreshed in Your presence
.          C           Em        D
   New hope, new life, You raise</lyrics>
