<lyrics>[V1]
 Lo, God to Heav'n ascendeth! Throughout its regions vast With shouts triumphant blendeth the trumpet's thrilling blast: Sing praise to Christ the Lord; sing praise with exultation, King of each heathen nation, the God of Hosts adored!

[V2]
 With joy is Heav'n resounding Christ's glad return to see; Behold the saints surrounding the Lord who set them free. Bright myriads, thronging, come; the cherub band rejoices, And loud seraphic voices Welcome Messiah home.

[V3]
 No more the way is hidden, Since Christ our Head arose: No more to man forbidden The road to Heav'n that goes. Our Lord is gone before; yet here He will not leave us, And soon in Heav'n receive us and open wide the door.

[V4]
 Christ is our place preparing; to Heav'n we, too, shall rise, And, joys angelic sharing, Be where our treasure lies: There may each heart be found! Where Jesus Christ has entered, There let our Hope be centered; Our course still heav'nward bound.

[V5]
 May we, His servants, thither In heart and mind ascend, And let us sing together: &quot;We seek Thee, Christ, our friend, Thee, God's exalted Son, our Life, and Way to Heaven, To whom all pow'r is given, our Joy and Hope and Crown.&quot;

[V6]
 Farewell with all thy treasures, O world, to falsehood giv'n!
 Thy dross gives no true pleasures; We seek the joys of Heav'n:
 The Savior is our Prize; He comforts us in sadness,
 And fills our hearts with gladness; to Him we lift our eyes.

[V7]
 When, on our vision dawning, Will break the wished-for hour
 Of that all glorious morning, When Christ shall come with power?
 O come, thou welcome day! When we, our Savior meeting,
 His second advent greeting, Shall hail the heav'n-sent ray.</lyrics>
