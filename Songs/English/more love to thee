<lyrics>[V1]
 More love to Thee, O Christ; More love to Thee; Hear Thou the pray'r I make On bended knee; This is my earnest plea, More love, O Christ, to Thee, More love to Thee; More love to Thee.

[V2]
 Once earthly joy I craved, Sought peace and rest; Now thee alone I seek, Give what is best; This all my pray'r shall be, More love, O Christ, to Thee, More love to Thee; More love to Thee.

[V3]
 Then shall my latest breath, Whisper Thy praise, This be the parting cry My heart shall raise; This still its pray'r shall be, More love, O Christ, to Thee, More love to Thee; More love to Thee.</lyrics>
