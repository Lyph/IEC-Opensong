<lyrics>[V1]
.G                             B5         D5     A  F# G
 Caught a glimpse of Your splendor in the corner of my eye,
.                   Bm                A5
 The most beautiful thing I'd ever seen;
.G                           B5     D5      A   F#  G
 It was like a flash of lightning reflected off the sky,
.                Bm           A  D
 And I know I'll never be the same.

[C1]
.  D            Bm
   Show me Your glory,
.  G                          G              Asus A
   Send down Your presence, I wanna see Your face;
.  D
    
.  D            Bm
   Show me Your glory,
.  G                            G                       F#    G B5D5AF#G
   Majesty shines about You and I can't go on without You, Lord.

[V2]
.G                         B5       D5       A  F# G
 When I climb down the mountain and get back to my life,
.                   Bm       A5
 I won't settle for ordinary things;
.G                       B5        D5  A  F# G
 I'm gonna follow You forever, for all of my days;
.                     Bm       A  D
 I won't rest until I see You again.</lyrics>
