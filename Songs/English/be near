<lyrics>[V1]
.Bm7        G2         Bm7            G2
 You are all, big and small, beautiful.
.Bm7          G2                         Bm7
 How wonderful to trust in grace through faith,
.                  G2
 But I'm asking to taste.

[P1]
.  Em7                   D2/F#
   For dark is light to You,
.                        G2
   Depths are height to You,
.                    Asus            A
   Far is near, but, Lord, I need to hear from You.

[C1]
.     D2        D/C#
   Be near, O God.
.        Bm7    D2/A
   Be near, O God of us.
.           G2   D2/F#      Asus A
   Your nearness is to us our good.
.     D         D2/C#
   Be near, O God.
.        Bm7    D2/A
   Be near, O God of us.
.           G2   D2/F#      Asus A (tochorus)
   Your nearness is to us our good,
.    Bm7  A (toverse)
   Our good.

[V2]
 Your fullness is mine, revelation divine.
 But, oh to taste, to know more than a page,
 To feel Your embrace.</lyrics>
