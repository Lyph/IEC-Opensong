<lyrics>[V1]
 God has spoken to His people,
 Alleluia!
 And His words are words of wisdom,
 Alleluia!

[V2]
 Open your ears, O Christian people,
 Open your ears, and hear good news.
 Open your ears, O royal priesthood,
 God has come to you,
 God has come to you.

[V3]
 He who has ears to hear His message,
 He who has ears then let him hear.
 He who would learn
 the way of wisdom,
 Let him hear God's word,
 Let him hear God's word.

[V4]
 Israel comes to greet the Saviour,
 Judah is glad to see His day.
 From East and West the peoples travel,
 He will show the way,
 He will show the way.</lyrics>
