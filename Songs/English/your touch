.Gm                       Bb
 Staring at a blank wall and all its white washed face
.C                 Bb
 Not knowing why I had to choose this way
.Gm        B
 I discern I was wrong in my way
.C                     B
 Looking for peace in another, another domain

[P1]
.  Eb            F             Gm
   And I realize that its true I seek you, yes I seek you
.  Eb            F             G
   And I realize that its true I need you, yes I need you

[C1]
.  G                 B              F                    Eb
   And I reach and I touch you and I know that I need you
.  G                   B              F
   To reach out and to touch me and I know
.                     Eb
   I know that I need your touch

[V2]
.Gm              Bb     C
 Not knowing why I ever retreated from your arms
.Bb
 A mistake I made
.Gm            Bb             C
 Now oh Lord I feel your warm embrace, contentment
.         Bb
 fills my soul as joy lights my face

[B1]
.  Dm
   You Look into the sky
.  Dm
   and see His arms of love reaching out for you
.  Dm
   His arms of love and grace
.  Dm
   And you know you need him, you need his touch
.  Dm
   I need your, I need your.....touch</lyrics>
