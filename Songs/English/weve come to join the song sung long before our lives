<lyrics>[V1]
 We've come to join the song sung long before our lives
 To raise our voice along heaven and Earth alike
 We've seen Your faithful hand Your mercy without end
 A king who bled and died a God who sacrificed

[V2]
 Chorus
 Be enthroned upon the praises of a thousand generations
 You are worthy Lord of all
 Unto You the slain and risen King we lift our voice with Heaven
 Singing worthy Lord of all

[V3]
 All through this life we lead and on to eternity
 Our endless praise will cry Jesus be glorified
 All through this life we lead and on to eternity
 Our endless praise will cry Jesus be glorified

[B1]
   Highest praises Lord of all
   Highest praises Lord of all
   Highest praises You are worthy Lord of all</lyrics>
