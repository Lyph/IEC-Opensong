.D                 G                   D/A
 Today I finally found a melody that fits,
.               G
 A melody that fits.
.D                 G                       D/A
 Today I finally found a song that I can sing,
.                   G
 A song that I can sing.

.             D    D/F#        G    A
   You are my King, You are my King;
.    Bm                       A                        G     A
   I bow down before You and crown You the King of all Kings.
.               D   D/F#           G    A
   Forever I'll sing, forever I'll sing:
.       Bm                     A                    G   A
   I'll sing of Your mercy and how I have been set free.
   I'm set free.

 The rulers of the earth will bow before Your throne,

 They'll bow before Your throne.
.D                     G                      D/A
 The nations You have made will worship You alone,
.                     G
 They'll worship You alone...They'll sing for You.

   I'm set free.
