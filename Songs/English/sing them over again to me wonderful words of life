 Sing them over again to me, wonderful words of life,
 Let me more of their beauty see, wonderful words of life;
 Words of life and beauty teach me faith and duty.

[C1]
   Beautiful words, wonderful words,
   Wonderful words of life,
   Beautiful words, wonderful words,
   Wonderful words of life.

[V2]
 Christ, the blessed One, gives to all wonderful words of life;
 Sinner, list to the loving call, wonderful words of life;
 All so freely given, wooing us to heaven.

[V3]
 Sweetly echo the Gospel call, wonderful words of life;
 Offer pardon and peace to all, wonderful words of life;
 Jesus, only Savior, sanctify us forever.</lyrics>
