 When trouble comes I trust in You
 For I know You will lead me through
 And I know You are faithful till the end

[V2]
 And when the storms are drawing near
 When I'm with You I don't have to fear
 You're my shepherd on whom I can depend

[C1]
   Through the day, Through the night
   I trust You'll guide me by Your light

[C2]
   Lord You are always by my side
   You never change, in You I hide
   You are the same yesterday and today
   and forevermore
   Here on your promises I stand
   You hold my future in Your hand
   My solid rock, Almighty God, I worship you</lyrics>
