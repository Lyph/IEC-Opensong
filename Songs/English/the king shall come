<lyrics>[V1]
 The King shall come when morning dawns, And light triumphant breaks; When beauty gilds the eastern hills, And life to joy awakes.

[V2]
 Not as of old a little child To bear, and fight, and die, But crowned with glory like the sun That lights the morning sky.

[V3]
 O brighter than the rising morn When He, victorious, rose, And left the lonesome place of death, Despite the rage of foes.

[V4]
 O brighter than that glorious morn Shall this fair morning be, When Christ, our King, in beauty comes, And we His face shall see.

[V5]
 The King shall come when morning dawns, And earth's dark night is past; O haste the rising of that morn, The day that aye shall last.

[V6]
 And let the endless bliss begin,
 By weary saints foretold,
 When right shall triumph over wrong,
 And truth shall be extolled.

[V7]
 The King shall come when morning dawns,
 And light and beauty brings:
 Hail, Christ the Lord! Thy people pray,
 Come quickly, King of kings.</lyrics>
