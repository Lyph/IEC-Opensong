 I will not fear
 The arrows or the night
 As thousands fall
 To my left and to my right

[V2]
 I will abide, in the safety of your shadow
 Under your wings, my heart will find its rest

[V3]
 The wicked fall
 And with my eyes I see
 But your faithfulness
 Will be a shield to me

[V4]
 Cause I have made, my dwelling place in You God
 And I'm not afraid, cause I am held by You God

[V5]
 Here in Your presence, I find my refuge oh Lord
 And here in the secret, I hear you whisper to me
 Here in Your presence, I find my refuge oh Lord
 And here in the secret, I hear you whisper to me</lyrics>
