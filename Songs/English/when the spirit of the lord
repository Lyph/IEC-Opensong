 When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart
 I will dance like David danced
 When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart
 I will dance like David danced

[C1]
   I will dance, dance, dance like David danced
   I will dance, dance, dance like David danced

[V2]
 When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart
 I will pray like David prayed
 When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart
 I will pray like David prayed

[C2]
   I will pray, pray, pray like David prayed
   I will pray, pray, pray like David prayed

[V3]
 When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart
 I will sing like David sang
 When the Spirit of the Lord comes upon my heart
 I will sing like David sang

[C3]
   I will sing, I will sing, sing like David sang
   I will sing, I will sing, sing like David sang
   I will pray, I will pray, pray like David prayed
   I will pray, I will pray, pray like David prayed
   I will dance, I will dance, dance like David danced
   I will dance, I will dance, dance like David danced</lyrics>
