<lyrics>[V1]
 God I give You all I can today
 These scattered ashes that I hid away
 I lay them all at Your feet
 From the corners of my deepest shame
 The empty places where I've worn Your name
 Show me the love I say I believe

[P1]
   Oh Help me to lay it down
   Oh Lord I lay it down

[C1]
   Oh let this be where I die
   My lord with thee crucified
   Be lifted high as my Kingdom's fall
   Once and for all, once and for all

[V2]
 There is victory in my Saviors loss
 And In the crimson flowing from the cross
 Pour over me, pour over me yes
 Oh let this be where I die
 My lord with thee crucified
 Be lifted high as my Kingdom's fall
 Once and for all, once and for all

[P2]
   Oh Lord I lay it down
   Oh Lord I lay it down
   Help me to lay it down
   Oh Lord I lay it down

[C2]
   Oh let this be where I die
   My Lord with thee crucified
   Be lifted high as my Kingdom's fall
   Once and for all
   Once and for all
   Oh once and for all
   Once and for all</lyrics>
