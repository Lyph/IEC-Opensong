 Verse: 1
.F#               C#/F        D#m
 One part water and one part dust
.         D#m                     C#     F#
 Yet You're still making trophies out of us
.        F#                              C#/F   D#m
 Making something out of nothing, it's what You do
.       D#m                                C#        F#
 Yet Your work is never finished and it's never past due

   Chorus:
.   C#                      D#m     F#
   Gently Your voice like a calming embrace
.   H           F#/A#          C#
   Calls me from out of the noise
.        C#                      D#m            F#
   You whisper to me, &quot;Child, forget not your dreams&quot;
.      H       F#/A#      C#
   As we lie awake in the dark

 Verse: 2
.         F#                       C#/F       D#m
 From the dirt to a throne with a brand new name
.        D#m                          C#        F#
 And the blood of the King runnin' through our veins
.         F#                   C#/F     D#m
 There's hidden gold in these jars of clay
.         D#m                       C#         H
 All these hidden crowns will be revealed one day
.              H                     C#       F#
 Yeah, we'll lay them down at your feet one day

   Calls me from out of the noise

   You whisper to me, &quot;Child, forget not your dreams&quot;
.      H       F#/A#      C#
   As we lie awake in the dark
