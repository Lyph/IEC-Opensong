<lyrics>[V1]
.    C      Dm
 When I look into Your holiness,
.        C        F
 When I gaze into Your loveliness,
.        C
 When all things that surround
.     Dm       Gsus G
 Become shadows in the light of You;

[V2]
.     C            Dm
 When I've found the joy of reaching Your heart,
.         C             F
 When my will becomes enthralled in Your love,
.        C
 When all things that surround
.     Dm      Gsus G
 Become shadows in the light of You:

[C1]
.          F   G     Em Am
   // I worship You,  I worship You,
.        Dm    G       C   F  C
   The reason I live  is to worship You.    //</lyrics>
