<lyrics>[V1]
 Great and wonderful are Thy wondrous deeds,
 O Lord God the Almighty
 Just and true are all Thy ways, O Lord,
 King of the ages art Thou.
 Who shall not fear and glorify
 Thy name, O Lord?
 For Thou alone are holy,
 Thou alone.
 All the nations shall come and worship Thee,
 For Thy glory shall be revealed,
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Amen.</lyrics>
