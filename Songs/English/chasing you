<title>Chasing You</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 You hide, I want to find You, go
 And I will follow You
 I want to be where You are

[V2]
 As you move, I'm right beside You, oh
 I'm running after You
 I want to be where You are

[V3]
 I'm chasing You
 I'm so in love
 Captivated, I just can't get enough
 I'll spend my days
 Running after Your heart
 Your heart, Your heart, Whoa

[V4]
 I'm chasing You
 With all my love
 Captivated, I just can't get enough
 I'll spend my days

[V5]
 Running after Your heart
 Your heart, Your heart, Whoa

[V6]
 Heart, You've won me heart and soul
 And where You lead I'll go
 I want to be where You are

[V7]
 From the moment I rise, to the moment I sleep
 My affection is for You, and even as I dream
 I want to know you, I'm after Your heart

[V8]
 This life, this love, was always meant to be
 A wild, crazy adventure, discovering
 The thrill, the rush, the more of You I see
 The more it leaves me wanting
 You're everything, You're everything</lyrics>
