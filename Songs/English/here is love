<lyrics>[V1]
.C2      G                 C2
 Here is love, vast as the ocean
.       G               D
 Loving kindness as the flood
.         G                   C2
 When the Prince of Life, our ransom
.         G      D/F#     G
 Shed for us His precious blood
.                      D/F#
 Who His love will not remember?
.        D7                G
 Who can cease to sing His praise?
.       Em7         C
 He can never be forgotten
.            G        D/F#    G
 Throughout Heav'n's eternal days

[V2]
.C2     G               C2
 On the mount of crucifixion
.          G               D
 Fountains opened deep and wide
.            G                   C2
 Through the floodgates of God's mercy
.         G        D/F#     G
 Flowed a vast and gracious tide
.                            D/G
 Grace and love, like mighty rivers
.                    G
 Pour incessant from above
.             Em7               C
 And Heav'n's peace and perfect justice
.         G      D/F#     G
 Kissed a guilty world in love</lyrics>
