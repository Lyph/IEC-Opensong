 My God is strong He'll do anything
 Big or small nothing is impossible
 For a super wonderful God

[P1]
   Every day I can know God is always there
   For me and my family
   Every day I can know Greater is the One
   Who lives inside me

[C1]
   Super big, super strong
   Super wonderful, God
   Super big, super strong
   Super wonderful, God</lyrics>
