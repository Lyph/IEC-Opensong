 A love so amazing has come to save me
 And this love changes everything
 Father You found me,
 Your goodness surrounds me
 I'm Yours for eternity

[C1]
   And You will always be
   The King on the throne
   Now Your praise will always be on my tongue
   No one else could do
   The things that You've done in my life
   There's no greater love that's ever been shown
   Now Your song in me just has to be sung
   No one else could do the things that You've done In my life

[V2]
 Your ways are faithful, Your works are beautiful
 Your word sets the captive free
 Your hand upon me, heals and restores me
 Your grace fills my every need

[B1]
   You said if I follow You
   I'll know the truth and do the things You do
   Yours is the kingdom and the power
   Forever Lord You will always be my God</lyrics>
