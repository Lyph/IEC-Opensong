.E                                         F#m
 I've watched my dreams all fade away, and blister in the sun;
.E                            D
 Everything I've ever had's unraveled and undone.
.E                                         F#m
 I've set upon a worthless stack, of my ambitious plans
.E                            D
 And the people that I've loved the most, have turned their backs and ran.

[C1]
.  A                                C#m
   This is the good life, I've lost everything
.          F#m            E             D
   I could ever want, and ever dream of.
.  A                                C#m
   This is the good life, I found everything
.          F#m            E             D
   I could ever need, here in Your arms.

[V2]
.E                                        F#m
 Loneliness has left me searching for someone to love.
.E                           D
 Poverty has changed my view of what true riches are.
.E                                         F#m
 Sorrow's opened up my eyes, To see what real joy is.
.E                          D
 Pain has been the catalyst to my heart's happiness.

[B1]
.  A                  C#m
   What good would it be
.  F#     E   D
   If you had everything,
.  A              C#m
   But you didn't have was
.  F#m  E   D
   The only thing you need?</lyrics>
