 O spread Your wings of mercy over me
 And guard my heart with true humility
 No shadow of the darkness pressing in
 Only the holy overshadowing
 Underneath Your wings, overshadowing

[V2]
 No refuge will I seek but God alone
 No hiding place save only at Your throne
 Only the cross, the blood to wash my sin
 Only the holy overshadowing
 Underneath Your wings, overshadowing

[V3]
 You are my shield, and my glory
 You are the lifter of my head
 And though the storms may rage around me
 I'll be safe within
 Beneath the holy overshadowing

[V4]
 No burden on my back too hard to bear
 Only the easy load You bid me wear
 Until these troubles pass, my heart will sing
 Praise for the holy overshadowing
 Underneath Your wings, overshadowing

[V5]
 Underneath Your wings
 Overshadowing, overshadowing.</lyrics>
