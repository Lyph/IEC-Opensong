<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus sinners doth receive; Well may we this saying ponder Who in sin's delusions live, And from God and Heaven wander: Here is hope for all who grieve\Jesus sinners doth receive.

[V2]
 We deserve but grief and shame,\Yet His words, rich grace revealing, Pardon, peace, and life proclaim; Here their ills have perfect healing Who with humble hearts believe\Jesus sinners doth receive.

[V3]
 As the shepherd seeks to find His lost sheep that from Him strayeth, So hath Christ each soul in mind, And for its salvation prayeth; Fain He'd have each wand'rer live: Jesus sinners doth receive.

[V4]
 Come, then, all by guilt oppressed, Jesus calls, and He would make you God's own children, pure and blest, And to glory He would take you; Think on this, and well believe Jesus sinners doth receive.

[V5]
 Savior, now I come to Thee: Great my sins, a weary burden! Wilt Thou mercy show to me? Can I hope to find a pardon? I will trust: my soul relieve! Me, a sinner, Lord, receive!

[V6]
 Rich Thy mercy\- strangely good! O how oft have I offended!
 But through Thy redeeming blood All my fear of wrath is ended:
 Yes I now can witness give: Jesus sinners doth receive!

[V7]
 Now my conscience is at peace; From the Law I stand acquitted;
 Christ hath purchased my release, And my every sin remitted.
 Naught remains my soul to grieve: Jesus sinners doth receive.

[V8]
 Jesus sinners doth receive! Happy in His ceaseless favor,
 Here for Heaven I will live, There shall live with Him forever,
 &quot;Joy in death these tidings give; Jesus sinners doth receive!&quot;</lyrics>
