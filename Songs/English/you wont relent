 You won't relent
 Until You have it all
 My heart is Yours

[C1]
   I'll set You as a seal upon my heart
   As a seal upon my arm
   For there is love that is as strong as death
   Jealousy demanding as the grave
   And many waters cannot quench this love

[V2]
 Come be the fire inside of me
 Come be the flame upon my heart
 Come be the fire inside of me
 Until You and I are one</lyrics>
