 Lord I'm grateful, amazed at what you've done
 My finest efforts are filthy rags
 But I'm made righteous by trusting in the Son
 I have God's riches at Christ's expense

[V2]
 'Cause it's grace there's nothing I can do
 To make You love me more
 To make You love me less than You do
 And by faith I'm standing on this stone
 Of Christ and Christ alone
 Your righteousness is all that I need
 'Cause it's grace

[V3]
 Called and chosen when I was far away
 You brought me into Your family
 Free forgiven my guilt is washed away
 Your loving kindness is life to me

[V4]
 Grace loves the sinner
 Loves all I am and all I'll ever be
 Makes me a winner
 Whatever lies the devil throws at me

[V5]
 Freely given but bought with priceless blood
 My life was ransomed at Calvary
 There my Jesus gave everything He could
 That I might live for eternity</lyrics>
