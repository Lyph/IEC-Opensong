.E                             BA
 We will give ourselves no rest
.                                  BF#m7
 'Till Your kingdom comes on earth;
.                                  E
 You've positioned watchmen on the walls.
.E                                    BA
 Now our prayers will flow like tears,
.                                     BF#m7
 For You've shared your heart with us;
.                               E
 God of heaven, on our knees we fall.

[P1]
.       A       B      A/C#               B
   Come down in power, reveal Your heart again;
.       A        B          A/C#                 B
   Come hear our cries, the tears that plead for rain.

[C1]
.        E
   We're knocking, knocking on the door of heaven,
.        C#m7
   We're crying, crying for this generation,
.        F#m7                             A              B
   We're praying for Your name to be known in all of the earth.
.        E
   We're watching, watching on the walls to see You,
.        C#m7
   We're looking, looking for a time of breakthrough,
.        F#m7
   We're praying for Your word to bear fruit
.  A             B                    E     (orINTRO)
   In all of the earth, in all of the earth.</lyrics>
