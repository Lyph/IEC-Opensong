 Dream after dream, You are speaking to me, breathing
 Word after word of kingdom come
 Here at Your feet, I can see the unseen, truly
 One look at You and I'm undone

[P1]
   I run to the throne room
   I run to the throne room

[C1]
   And I fall on my face
   With angels and saints and all I can say is
   Нoly, holy, holy are You
   My heart can't contain
   The we ight of Your name and all I can say is
   Нoly, holy, holy are You

[V2]
 Grace upon grace, all my Fear falls away, only
 Your perfect love for me remains, oh
 Time after time, You stay close by my side, burning
 Fire inside I can't contain

[B1]
   I run to the throne room
   Before You, the only One
   I run to the throne room
   Before You, I'm overcome</lyrics>
