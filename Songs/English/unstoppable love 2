 Unstoppable Love

[V2]
 Try to stop Your love and You would wage a war
 Try to take the very thing You gave Your life for
 And You would come running tear down every wall
 All the while shouting My love you're worth it all

[C1]
   God You pursue me with power and glory
   Unstoppable love that never ends
   You're unrelenting with passion and mercy
   Unstoppable love that never ends

[V3]
 You broke into the silence and sang a song of hope
 A melody resounding in the deep of my soul
 You have come running You tore down every wall
 All the while shouting My love you're worth it all

[B1]
   No sin no shame no past no pain
   Can separate me from Your love
   No height no depth no fear no death
   Can separate me from Your love</lyrics>
