<lyrics>[V1]
 Let love explode and bring the dead to life
 A love so bold to see a revolution somehow.

[P1]
   Now I'm lost in your freedom
   This world I'll overcome.

[C1]
   My God is not dead He's surely alive
   He's living on the inside roaring like a lion
   My God is not dead He's surely alive
   He's living on the inside roaring like a lion

[V2]
 Let hope arise and make the darkness hide
 My faith is dead I need a resurrection somehow

[B1]
   Let Heaven roar and fire fall
   Come shake the ground
   With the sound of revival</lyrics>
