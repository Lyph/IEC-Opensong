 1 VERSE:
 My God is a Holy Elohim,
 My God is a God of Abraham,
 Who is like You? No one else.
 Its time to worship You, my Lord
 You are Creator of this world,
 All other gods are just false.

[C1]
   PRE CHORUS:
   You said and it's done
   You are the only One.

[C2]
   CHORUS:
   My God You're amazing, You're amazing!
   Your love's healing my soul and my heart.
   My God You're amazing, You're amazing!
   There's no, no one like You, my God.

[V2]
 2 VERSE:
 And on Your Throne in the sky,
 You worried that I might die.
 You gave Your Son to sacrifice,
 So I could go to paradise.</lyrics>
