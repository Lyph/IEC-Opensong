 Awake, my soul, and with the sun Thy daily stage of duty run; Shake off dull sloth, and joyful rise, To pay thy morning sacrifice.

[V2]
 Thy precious time misspent, redeem, Each present day thy last esteem, Improve thy talent with due care; For the great day thyself prepare.

[V3]
 By influence of Light divine Let thy own light to others shine. Reflect all Heaven's propitious ways In ardent love, and cheerful praise.

[V4]
 In conversation be sincere; Keep conscience as the noontide clear; Think how all seeing God thy ways And all thy secret thoughts surveys.

[V5]
 Wake, and lift up thyself, my heart, And with the angels bear thy part, Who all night long unwearied sing High praise to the eternal King.

[V6]
 All praise to Thee, Who safe has kept
 And hast refreshed me while I slept
 Grant, Lord, when I from death shall wake
 I may of endless light partake.

[V7]
 Heav'n is, dear Lord, where'er Thou art,
 O never then from me depart;
 For to my soul 'tis hell to be
 But for one moment void of Thee.

[V8]
 Lord, I my vows to Thee renew;
 Disperse my sins as morning dew.
 Guard my first springs of thought and will,
 And with Thyself my spirit fill.

[V9]
 Direct, control, suggest, this day,
 All I design, or do, or say,
 That all my powers, with all their might,
 In Thy sole glory may unite.

[V10]
 I would not wake nor rise again
 And Heaven itself I would disdain,
 Wert Thou not there to be enjoyed,
 And I in hymns to be employed.

[V11]
 Praise God, from Whom all blessings flow;
 Praise Him, all creatures here below;
 Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;
 Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</lyrics>
