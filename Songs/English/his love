<lyrics>[V1]
.    E       A               E          B
 His love is higher than the highest of mountains.
.    E         A               E          B
 His love goes deeper than the deepest of seas.
.    E          A              E        B
 His love, it stretches to the farthest horizon,
.        A                   E
 And His love, it reaches to me.

[V2]
 His love is stronger than the angels and demons.
 His love, it keeps me in my life's darkest hour.
 His love secures me on the pathway to heaven,
 And His love is my strength and power.

[V3]
 His love is sweeter than the sweetest of honey.
 His love is better than the choicest of wine.
 His love, it satisfies the deepest of hunger,
 And His love in Jesus, it's mine.

[V4]
 Your love is sweeter than the sweetest of honey.
 Your love is better than the choicest of wine.
 Your love, it satisfies the deepest of hunger,
 And Your love in Jesus, it's mine.

[V5]
 Your love is stronger than the angels and demons.
 Your love, it keeps me in my life's darkest hour.
 Your love secures me on the pathway to heaven,
 And Your love is my strength and power.</lyrics>
