 Everyday they pass me by I can see it in their eyes
 Empty people filled with care Headed who knows where
 On they go through private pain living fear to fear
 Laughter hides their silent cries jnly Jesus hears

[C1]
   People need the Lord, people need the Lord
   At the end of broken dreams, He's the open door
   People need the Lord, people need the Lord
   When will we realize people need the Lord?

[V2]
 We are called to take His light to a world where wrong seems right
 What could be too great a cost for sharing life with one who's lost?
 Through His love our hearts can feel all the grief they bear
 They must hear the words of life only we can share</lyrics>
