<lyrics>[V1]
.D                  G
 I will offer up my life
.   A7sus4     Bm7
 In spirit and truth,
.                       G
 Pouring out the oil of love
.      A7sus4     D
 As my worship to You.
.                    G       A7sus4 Bm7
 In surrender I must give my every  part;
.                  G
 Lord, receive the sacrifice
.     A7sus4 D
 Of a broken heart.

[C1]
.         Bm         G     A7sus4     D
   Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
.        Bm         G             A7sus4   D
   To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King?
.           Bm          G     A7sus4      D
   Saviour, what can be said, what can be sung
.       Bm             G             A7sus4          D
   As a praise of Your name, for the things You have done?
.                         Em7       D/F#    G
   Oh, my words could not tell, not even in part,
.         Em7     D/F#         G
   Of the debt of love that is owed
.     A7sus4   A7   D
   By this thankful heart.

[V2]
 You deserve my every breath
 For You've paid the great cost;
 Giving up Your life to death,
 Even death on a cross.
 You took all my shame away,
 There defeated my sin,
 Opened up the gates of heaven,
 And have beckoned me in.</lyrics>
