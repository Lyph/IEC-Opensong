<lyrics>[V1]
 We give Thee but Thine own, Whate'er the gift may be; All that we have is Thine alone, A trust, O Lord, from Thee.

[V2]
 May we Thy bounties thus As stewards true receive, And gladly, as Thou blessest us, To Thee our firstfruits give.

[V3]
 O hearts are bruised and dead, And homes are bare and cold, And lambs for whom the Shepherd bled Are straying from the fold.

[V4]
 To comfort and to bless, To find a balm for woe, To tend the lone and fatherless Is angels' work below.

[V5]
 The captive to release, To God the lost to bring, To teach the way of life and peace? It is a Christlike thing.

[V6]
 And we believe Thy Word,
 Though dim our faith may be;
 Whate'er for Thine we do, O Lord,
 We do it unto Thee.</lyrics>
