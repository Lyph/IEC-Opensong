.Em
 If I rise on wings of dawn
.   D/E
 Or drift in seas of doubt,
.Em
 Even there Your strong right hand
.    D/E
 Has never failed to guide me out.

[C1]
.  G
   Great is Your faithfulness
.                     Am             C
   To carry on with a sinner like me.
.  G
   Great is Your faithfulness,
.                     Am      C
   Turning shame into victory.
.       Em              A
   Your grace has never let me be;
.       Em             A
   Your mercy's waited patiently.
.         G
   Oh, so great is Your faithfulness
.                     Am             C
   To carry on with a sinner like me.

[V2]
.Em
 If I hide in dark and shadows,
.D/E
 Fearful of each day,
.Em
 Even there Your blinding light
.  D/E
 Illuminates my pathway.
