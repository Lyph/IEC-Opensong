 How hard it is on the heart sometimes
 When traveling on this treacherous and narrow path
 But I continue to walk with you, my Savior
 How you instructed me to walk after You

[V2]
 I am a stranger and prisoner in a foreign land
 Not loved by anyone, and by everyone forgotten
 My harp is hanging from the willow tree
 My song is dying, the strings sound not

[V3]
 And often it happens, how cries an infant,
 Like so, I lament and in mourning I pray
 And to the glorious homeland, which I dearly love
 With all my heart, soul, and spirit, I look forward

[V4]
 In the azure sky, where the sun rises
 There, to the skies, I direct my glance
 There, the tired traveler will find his shelter
 Where everyones desired peace

[V5]
 And an unearthly song will sound 'on air,'
 With that heavenly song I will join my voice
 But for now, as a wanderer and prisoner on this earth
 I just sing my sad song...</lyrics>
