 This life is just a fleeting shadow
 I realise that life is found in You alone

[V2]
 Until my heart has found its home
 With all the saints before Your throne
 I'll live my life for You alone
 'Cause You call me Your own

[V3]
 You shine brighter than the brightest sun
 Your light endures when all is said and done

[V4]
 You're the lion, You're the lamb
 The first and last, The Great I Am
 The Son of God, the Son of Man
 With wounds in Your hands

[V5]
 Forever, oh Lord, You will be the Eternal Son</lyrics>
