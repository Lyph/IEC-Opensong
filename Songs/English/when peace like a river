<lyrics>[V1]
.     C                    F          C
 When peace like a river attendeth my way,
.     Am           D           G
 When sorrows like sea billows roll;
.    C       F              D            G
 Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
.       C           F    G    C
 &quot;It is well, it is well with my soul.&quot;

[C1]
.        C            G
   It is well, (it is well,)
.          G              C
   With my soul, (with my soul,)
.        F           C    G       C
   It is well, it is well with my soul.

[V2]
.       C                           F             C
 Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
.    Am           D          G
 Let this blest assurance control,
.     C            F         D         G
 That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
.         C            F     G      C
 And hath shed his own blood for my soul.

[V3]
.   C                         F        C
 My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought!
.   Am          D            G
 My sin, not in part but the whole
.   C             F            D          G
 Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
.           C                F     G    C
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

[V4]
.     C                           F              C
 And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
.    Am               D         G
 The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
.    C             F              D            G
 The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
.     C         F    G       C
 Even so, it is well with my soul.</lyrics>
