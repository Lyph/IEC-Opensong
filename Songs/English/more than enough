 I return once again
 To the place where I belong
 Though I've turned, I repent
 God I know that I've done wrong
 I need You, I need love
 God, You're more than enough for me

[V2]
 Now this fight is as real
 As the ground beneath my feet
 And it pulls, and it draws
 And it eats away at me
 But I choose You, I choose love
 God, You're more than enough for me

[V3]
 Though I swim against the tide
 I know I'll be satisfied by You
 And though I fight against my flesh
 I know I will find my rest in You

[V4]
 Make a highway in me
 For Your love to come on through
 Break the chains, break the walls
 In between my heart and You
 Fill me up, fill me up
 God, You're more than enough for me

[V5]
 You're my rock and my joy
 You're the everlasting truth
 There is none in this world
 I desire more than You
 I want You, I want love
 God, You're more than enough for me

[V6]
 Jesus, You can satisfy
 Only You can satisfy
 When I'm thirsty and I'm dry
 I come to You Lord

[V7]
 Oh God fill me completely
 And make me completely in love

[V8]
 Don't let me go away
 Just keep me by Your side
 You see me differently
 Behind those burning eyes

[V9]
 So keep me here, keep my now, forever
 I am Yours, I am Yours, forever
 There is none besides You God, forever
 And forever we will sing
 Forever we will sing</lyrics>
