.G/B       C           G/B               C
 From wherever spring arrives to heal the ground,
.G/B       C             G/B               C
 From wherever searching comes, the look itself,
.G/B         C                 G/B
 A trace of what we're looking for,
.            C       G/B  C
 So be quiet now and wait.

[P1]
.  D         C D       C
   The ocean is growing.
.  D           C
   The tide is coming in. Here it is.

[C1]
.              G                 G/B
   Here is our King. Here is our Love.
.              C
   Here is our God who's come
.                      G
   To bring us back to Him.
.            G/B         C
   He is the One. He is Jesus.

[V2]
.G/B      C                G/B              C
 And what was said to the rose to make it unfold
.G/B         C              G/B
 Was said to me here in my chest,
.       C            G/B  C
 So be quiet now and rest.

[B1]
.  Em  D/F# G  Am  G/B  C

.  Em  D/F# G  Am  G/B C D
   Ma__jes__ty fi__nally here.

[B2]
.  Em  D/F# G  C Em D/F# C    G
   Ma__jes__ty fi___nally here.</lyrics>
