 You are holy You are mighty
 You are worthy worthy of praise
 I will follow I will listen
 I will love you all of my days

[C1]
   I will sing to, and worship the King who is worthy
   I will love and adore Him and I will bow down before Him
   I will sing to, and worship the King who is worthy
   I will love and adore Him and I will bow down before Him

[C2]
   You are lord of lords You are king of kings
   You are mighty god Lord of everything
   You're Emmanuel You're the great I am
   You're the prince of peace Who is the lamb
   You're the living GodYou're my saving grace
   You will reign forever You are ancient of days
   You are alpha, omega beginning and end
   You're my savior, messiah, redeemer and friend</lyrics>
