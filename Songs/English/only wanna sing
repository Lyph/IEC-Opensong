[V3]
 VERSE 1
.Em     C
 This is no performance
.G      D/F#
 Lord I pray it's worship
.Em   C              G    D/F
 Empty words I can't afford
.Em       C
 I'm not chasing feelings
.G          D/F#
 That's not why I'm singing
.Em        C            G    D/F
 You're the reason for my song

[V4]
 CHORUS
.Em7          C2           G
 I              only want to sing
.     D/F#           Em7
 If I sing with everything
.      C2             G     D/F#
 If I sing for You my King, oh
.Em7       C             G
 I          can't imagine why
.        D/F#          Em
 I would do this all for hype
.           C               G     D/F
 'Cause it's all to lift You high, oh

[V5]
 INSTRUMENTAL

[V6]
 VERSE 2
 You don't want perfection
 Just my soul's attention
 All I have is what I'll give
 And more than a song that lasts a moment
 I'll live a life of honest worship
 If I'm here to sing, then I'll sing with purpose
 All the praise, Lord, You deserve it

[V7]

 FINAL CHORUS
.    Em7       C2          G
 And I          only want to sing
.     D/F#          Em7
 If I sing with everything
.     C2             G     D/F# C
 If I sing for You my King, oh__</lyrics>
