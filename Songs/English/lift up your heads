<lyrics>[V1]
 Lift up your heads, O you gates,
 Swing wide you everlasting doors
 Lift up your heads, O ye gates
 Swing wide you everlasting doors

[V2]
 That the King of glory may come in
 That the King of glory may come in
 That the King of glory may come in
 That the King of glory may come in

[V3]
 Up from the dead He ascends
 Through every rank of heavenly power
 Let heaven prepare the highest place
 Throw wide the everlasting doors

[V4]
 With trumpet blast and shouts of joy
 All heaven greets the risen King
 With angel choirs come line the way
 Throw wide the gates and welcome Him</lyrics>
