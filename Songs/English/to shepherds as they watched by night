<lyrics>[V1]
 To shepherds as they watched by night Appeared a host of angels bright; Behold the tender Babe, they said, In yonder lowly manger laid.

[V2]
 At Bethlehem, in David's town, As Micah did of old make known; 'Tis Jesus Christ, your Lord and King, Who doth to all salvation bring.

[V3]
 Oh, then rejoice that through His Son God is with sinners now at one; Made like yourselves of flesh and blood, Your Brother is th'eternal God.

[V4]
 What harm can sin and death then do? The true God now abides with you. Let hell and Satan rage and chafe, Christ is your Brother ye are safe.

[V5]
 Not one He will or can forsake Who Him his confidence doth make. Let all his wiles the Tempter try, You may his utmost pow'rs defy.

[V6]
 Ye shall and must at last prevail;
 God's own ye are, ye cannot fail.
 To God forever sing your praise
 With joy and patience all your days.</lyrics>
