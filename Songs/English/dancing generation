.     D
 Your mercy taught us how to dance
.   Bm
 To celebrate with all we have
.          G                      D
 And we'll dance to thank you for mercy

[V2]
.     D
 Your Glory taught us how to shout
.   Bm
 To lift Your name over all the earth
.          G                      D
 And we'll shout to thank you for glory

[P1]
.           Em7
   It's the overflow
.          D/F#
   Of a forgiven soul
.               G
   And now that we've seen you God
.      A
   Our hearts cannot stay silent

[C1]
.            D
   And we'll be a dancing generation
.  Em7                                 G
   Dancing because of Your great mercy Lord
.                   D
   Your great mercy Lord
.            D
   And we'll be a shouting generation
.  Em7                                  G
   Shouting because of Your great glory Lord
.                   D
   Your great Glory Lord</lyrics>
