 Verse: 1
.          F#               G#m
 The life You gave, Your body was broken
.H
 Your love poured out, You bled and You died for me
.          D#m         C#                       H
 There on that cross, You breathed Your last as you were crucified
 You gave it all for me

 Verse: 2
.          F#                  G#m
 There in the ground, sealed in the darkness
.       H
 Lifeless laid, the frame of the Father's son
.    D#m     C#           A#m         H
 In agony, He watched His only Son be sacrificed
 He gave it all for me

 But on that day, what seemed as the darkest hour

 A violent hope, broke through and shook the ground
.        D#m        C#          A#m            H
 And as You rose, The Light of all the world was magnified

 And You rose in victory
