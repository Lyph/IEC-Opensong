<title>I Belong To You</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Your love has won my heart forever
 Not because of anything I've done
 But You have scaled the hills and mountains
 Just to search and find the one You love
 I belong to You
 I belong to You
 I belong to You
 Forever Yours
 And when I was drowning in my doubt
 Your mighty right hand lifted me out
 And now we are walking on the water
 'Cause You lift my head above the crowd
 And when this life is over
 And I stand to see You face to face
 There's nothing that I will have wanted
 But to be with the One
 I belong to always</lyrics>
