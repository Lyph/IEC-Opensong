<lyrics>[V1]
 I lay my life down at Your feet
 Cause You're the only One I need
 I turn to You and You are always there
 In troubled times it's You I seek
 I put You first that's all I need
 I humble all I am, all to You

[C1]
   One way, Jesus, You're the only One that I could live for
   One way, Jesus, You're the only One that I could live for

[V2]
 You are always always there
 Everyhow and everywhere
 Your grace abounds so deeply within me
 You will never ever change
 Yesterday, today the same
 Forever 'til forever meets no end

[B1]
   You are the Way, the Truth, and the Life
   We live by faith and not by sight, for You
   We're living all for You</lyrics>
