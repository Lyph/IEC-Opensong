 Oh blest the house, whate'er befall, Where Jesus Christ is All in All; Yea, if He were not dwelling there, How poor and dark and void it were!

[V2]
 Oh blest that house where faith ye find, And all within have set their mind To trust their God and serve Him still, And do in all His holy will.

[V3]
 Blest, where their prayers shall daily rise As fragrant incense to the skies, While in their lives the world is taught That forms without the heart are naught.

[V4]
 Blest, where the busy hands fulfil Their proper task with ready skill, While through their different works ye see One spirit run of unity.

[V5]
 Blest such a house, it prospers well, In peace and joy the parents dwell, And in their children's lot is shown How richly God can bless His own.

[V6]
 Then here will I and mine to-day
 A solemn covenant make, and say,--
 Though all the world forsake Thy Word,
 I and my house will serve the Lord.</lyrics>
