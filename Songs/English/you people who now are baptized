<lyrics>[V1]
 You people who now are baptized God's gracious love surrounds you. By Christ's Name you're now recognized; Ponder what happened to you: Whose work was it which fashioned you, Whose inborn nature that He slew, When you first gained His promise?

[V2]
 Before held in your mother's arm, From your time of conception, Quite hostile to the Law's alarms\Let there be no deception. A sinner born of sinner's seed; Still God Himself for you would bleed, He took on flesh to save you.

[V3]
 Your soul and body turned within, Sin filled you like a poison. Concern for neighbor paperthin; God's love was simply foreign. Then raised by God the Lord of Life To glow in His eternal Light Your robe of white is gleaming.

[V4]
 The majesty that terrifies Was all God's presence brought you. Your fault you could not rectify; Anxiety consumed you. A slave of sin and Satan held Trapped in a prison bound for hell Death was your only future.

[V5]
 Then washed clean in this holy flood, The water of Baptism; Instilled faith in Christ's holy blood Brought to the Father's Kingdom, Your heart rebuilt within your breast, New nature filled with righteousness, Your every sin forgiven!

[V6]
 It washes all your sins away
 And makes you pure and holy.
 Hell's hold on you was lost that day,
 God's freedom for the lowly.
 You are now truly God's dear child
 An heir of heaven undefiled
 With crown to cast before Him.

[V7]
 Your nature lost in Adam's fall,
 Corrupt through generations,
 Refreshed now in the waterfall-
 A perfect new creation!
 The death of death before your eyes:
 God's power must be recognized.
 Hell's demons lie defeated!

[V8]
 Now we can gladly draw to Christ
 And boldly ask His blessing
 Because of Jesus' sacrifice,
 Our sins upon Him pressing.
 The Father looks on us and sees
 Christ's holiness and His good deeds:
 White robes giv'n by His merit.

[V9]
 This holy bath ... What pow'r displays!
 What wondrous grace-filled cleansing;
 None on their own can e'er appraise
 The value of their raising.
 The Word of God in simple form
 Can calm the tempest and the storm.
 It brings peace to your spirit.

[V10]
 Plain water cannot wash our sin
 Nor clean our inward spirit,
 But water with God's promise can
 Bring all the Father wills it.
 The water that floods over you
 From God's command has strength imbued.
 His Name is placed upon you.

[V11]
 Too precious to repay somehow,
 Just grateful thanks we offer.
 Christ's work has been delivered now
 To you through Word and water.
 Nothing but Christ's atoning work
 In you could kill death's ugly smirk
 You're now refreshed and holy.

[V12]
 Now gladly live as God's dear child
 Proclaim to all His Gospel
 Shine to the world; be undefiled...
 A beacon to all people.
 Till called home to eternal joy
 With new song that we'll all employ
 To cast our crowns before Him.</lyrics>
