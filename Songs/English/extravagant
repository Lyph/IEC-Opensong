 Verse: 1
.C#
 You were a lover before time's beginning
.F#                            F#    G#
 You gave Your love freely with holding nothing,  Jesus, my Jesus
.C#
 You carried the weight of the world on Your shoulders
.F#                           F#      G#
 You stopped at nothing to prove you were for us,  Jesus, my Jesus

[C1]
   Chorus:
.  F#          C#            G#
   It's extravagant,  it doesn't make sense
.              F#         F#
   We'll never comprehend, the way You love us
.             C#         G#
   It's unthinkable,  only heaven knows
.              F#           F#
   Just how far You'd go,  to say You love us  (To say You love us)

[V2]
 Verse: 2
.C#
 You don't belittle our pain and our suffering
.F#                        F#       G#
 You comfort us in our greatest unraveling,  Jesus, my Jesus
.C#
 You are the dawn that is breaking within me
.F#                          F#      G#
 You are the sun that is rising around me,  Jesus, my Jesus

[B1]
   Bridge:
.  D#          F
   Here is all my love
.               F
   It's yours, no conditions

   When you pull me close, no I won't resist

[C2]
   Chorus:
.  F#          C#            G#
   It's extravagant,  it doesn't make sense

   We'll never comprehend, the way You love us
.             C#         G#
   It's unthinkable,  only heaven knows
.              F#           F#
   Just how far You'd go,  to say You love us  (To say You love us)</lyrics>
