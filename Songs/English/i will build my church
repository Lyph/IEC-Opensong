<lyrics>[V1]
 I will build My church, ( I will build My church )
 And the gates of hell, ( and the gates of hell )
 Shall not prevail, ( shall not prevail ) Against it.
 I will build My church, ( I will build My church )
 And the gates of hell, ( and the gates of hell )
 Shall not prevail, ( shall not prevail ) Against it..

[C1]
   So you powers in the heavens above, Bow Down !
   So you powers on the earth below, Bow Down !
   And acknowledge that Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Is Lord...., Is Lord..</lyrics>
