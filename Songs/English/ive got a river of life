.D                                G      D
 I've got a river of life flowing out of me!
.D                       Bm      E        A7
 Makes the lame to walk, and the blind to see.
.D                            G        D
 Opens prison doors, sets the captives free!
.D                        Bm      D   A  D
 I've got a river of life flowing out of me!

[C1]
.  G                            D
   Spring up, O well, within my soul!
.  G                  E7          A
   Spring up, O well, and make me whole!
.  G                           D
   Spring up, O well, and give to me
.  G    D    A        D
   That life abundantly.</lyrics>
