<lyrics>[V1]
 Let our gladness have no end, Hallelujah! For to earth did Christ descend. Hallelujah! On this day God gave us Christ, His Son, to save us; Christ, His Son, to save us.

[V2]
 See, the loveliest blooming rose, Hallelujah! From the branch of Jesse grows. Hallelujah! On this day God gave us Christ, His Son, to save us; Christ, His Son, to save us.

[V3]
 Into flesh is made the Word. Hallelujah! He, our refuge and our Lord. Hallelujah! On this day God gave us Christ, His Son, to save us; Christ, His Son, to save us.</lyrics>
