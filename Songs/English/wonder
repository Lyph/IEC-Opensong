 Verse: 1
.H
 Have you ever seen the wonder
.H
 In the glimmer of first sight
.            E
 As the eyes begin to open
.          G#m7
 And the blindness meets the light
.E
 If you have so say

[C1]
   Chorus:
.  H
   I see the world in light
.  H
   I see the world in wonder
.  H
   I see the world in life
.  H
   Bursting in living colour
.  E
   I see the world Your way
.              H
   And I'm walking in the light

[V2]
 Verse: 2
.H
 Have you ever seen the wonder
.H
 In the air of second life

 Having come out of the waters

 With the old one left behind

[V3]
 If you have so say
