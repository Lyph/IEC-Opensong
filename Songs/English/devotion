<lyrics>[V1]
.G      Am              F
 All my world, all I've lost,
.                C                       Gsus
 The wrecks I've made here, the lives it cost.
.          G  Am                     F
 Your hand restores, Your words make whole.
.            C
 With all my soul, I thank You. I owe You all my...

[C1]
.    G
   Devotion.
.             C
   All that I have to give.
.              G
   Here's my devotion
.                     C
   You're all that it means to live.

[V2]
.G      Am               F
 All my past, my tainted name,
.              C                   Gsus
 You stole its legacy of pride and shame.
.       G     Am                 F
 You're all I love, You're all I fear.
.            C
 I'm drawing near to face You, to know You, to show You

[B1]
.      F
   You found me in a shallow grave.
.      Am
   You dragged me out from beneath it all.
.      F
   You healed me, saved me
.         C
   In the nick of time, Your perfect time.
.      F
   You found me in a shallow grave.
.      Am
   You called me out from beneath it all.
.      F
   You touched me, saved me
.         C
   In the nick of time, in Your perfect time.
.      G
   I devote all I have to You.
.      G
   I devote all that You've made new,
.             C
   All You restored that day You bled,
.               C
   All that You brought back from the dead. Oh!

[B2]
.                G
   My Lord, my devotion.</lyrics>
