 I see Your fingerprints
 The work of Your hands
 It's all in Your hands
 I see the evidence
 Leaving nothing to chance
 The world's in Your hands

[P1]
   So I rest in Your promises
   Now I am sure of this - i'm Yours

[C1]
   Let the waters rise
   I will stand as the oceans roar
   Let the earth shake beneath me
   Let the mountains fall
   You are God over the storm
   And I am Yours

[V2]
 I hear the voice of love
 Calling me home
 To where I belong
 It cripples every fear
 And the ones who will kneel
 Will walk away healed

[P2]
   So I rest in Your promises
   Now I am sure of this - i'm Yours
   No power is strong enough
   To separate me from Your love - i'm Yours...

[C2]
   So let the waters rise
   I will stand as the oceans roar
   Let the earth shake beneath me
   Let the mountains fall
   You are God over the storm
   And I am Yours

[B1]
   Even the thunder and the wind obey
   At the command of my Father, Father
   I set my feet upon Your mighty name
   So let the rain fall harder, harder
   So take my everything, my flesh and blood
   I'll lay me down on the altar, altar
   I am forever covered in Your love
   So let the rain fall hard

[C3]
   So let the waters rise
   I will stand as the oceans roar
   Let the earth shake beneath me
   Let the mountains fall
   You are God over the storm
   And I am Yours
   Let the waters rise
   I will stand as the oceans roar
   Let the earth shake beneath me
   Let the mountains fall
   You are God over the storm
   And I am Yours

[V3]
 You are God over the storm
