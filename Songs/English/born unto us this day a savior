 Born unto us this day a Savior
 Gifted from heaven to a manger
 The hope of the world, a light for all mankind
 All of the earth rejoice, it's Christmas time

[C1]
   So lift up your voice and sing out His praise, it's Christmas
   Born is the King, rejoice in the day, it's Christmas
   Make a joyful sound, it's Christmas
   Let His praise resound, it's Christmas

[V2]
 Goodwill to all the earth and peace divine
 All of the earth rejoice, it's Christmas time, it's Christmas time</lyrics>
