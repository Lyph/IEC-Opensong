 Be my vision when the waves are closing in
 Keep my focus on the peace, You breathed within
 And my heart will fear no more
 As I turn to face You, Lord

[C1]
   Take this life let glory and majesty
   Flood my eyes Lord, overwhelm me till
   all that I want and all that I see is You
   Till all that I see is You

[V2]
 Be my vision when I've reached life's greatest day
 Give me wisdom that I will humble myself and pray
 Teach my heart to lean on You
 Lord, in everything I do

[C2]
   Take this life let glory and majesty
   Flood my eyes Lord, overwhelm me till
   All that I want and all that I see is You
   Step by step, Jesus, I'll follow You
   Breath by breath, Lord, I will worship You
   Burn in my heart till all that I see is You

[C3]
   PostTill all that I see is You, till all that I see is You
   Till all that I see is You, Jesus
   Till all that I see is You, till all that I see is You
   Till all that I see is You, Jesus

[B1]
   I can see You now, I can see You now
   Lord, You are here with me You're present in everything
   So I'll lift my voice I have resolved to serve You, Lord
   Jesus be all I see, Jesus in everything

[C4]
   Take this life let glory and majesty
   Flood my eyes Lord, overwhelm me till
   All that I want and all that I see is You
   Step by step, Jesus, I'll follow You
   Breath by breath, Lord, I will worship You
   Burn in my heart till all that I see is You

[C5]
   PostTill all that I see is You, till all that I see is You
   Till all that I see is You, Jesus
   Till all that I see is You, till all that I see is You
   Till all that I see is You, Jesus</lyrics>
