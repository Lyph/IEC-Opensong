<lyrics>[V1]
 If you gotta start somewhere why not here
 If you gotta start sometime why not now
 If we gotta start somewhere I say here
 If we gotta start sometime I say now

[P1]
   Through the fog there is hope in the distance
   From cathedrals to third world missions
   Love will fall to the earth like a crashing wave

[C1]
   Tonight's the night for the sinners and the saints
   Two worlds collide in a beautiful display
   It's all up tonight when we step across the line
   We can sail across the sea to a city with one king

[V2]
 A city on our knees
 A city on our knees
 Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[B1]
   Tonight could last forever
   We are one choice from together
   Tonight could last forever, ooh
   Tonight could last forever
   We are one choice from together
   As family We're family
   Oh Tonight could last forever
   We are one choice from together
   You and me Ya, you and me

[V3]
 Ening:
 If we gotta start somewhere why not here
 If we gotta start sometime why not now</lyrics>
