<lyrics>[V1]
 Awake my soul, an off'ring bring to Jesus our exalted King; Sing to Him Who reigns above incarnate fount of grace and love; Sing to Him Who reigns above incarnate fount of grace and love.

[V2]
 In awe we stand upon this ground, His wisdom and His pow'r astound; All His wonders we behold, in heav'n and earth His story's told; All His wonders we behold, in heav'n and earth His story's told.

[V3]
 Then to this world, behold what grace! He comes to rescue Adam's race; Our Redeemer, our High Priest, from sin and death He brings release; Our Redeemer, our High Priest, from sin and death He brings release.

[V4]
 Awake my soul, arise and sing, eternal praise to Christ our King; In His Church, His Name confessed, we worship Him among the blessed; In His Church, His Name confessed, we worship Him among the blessed.</lyrics>
