 Old as the hills, new everyday
 It's in the bones like it's DNA
 First taste is sweet 'til it rots in your mouth
 Another old friend who rats you out

[P1]
   All of the time in this life
   Can't loose the ties that bind
   They shackle our feet, we trip, we fall, we crawl
   I was born in the mess of it all

[C1]
   Then You rescued me, rescued me
   Lord, with a touch of Your hand
   Another captive free again
   Who else in heaven could do this but You?
   You rescued me, rescued me
   Lord, with a love out of mind
   Oh, You know I love it when
   Everyday I am rescued again

[V2]
 Over the years your nature's way
 Is turning wrongs into roles you play
 Caught in a spell that's overcast
 You gain perspective, it doesn't last

[P2]
   All of the time in this life
   Can't loose the ties that blind you
   They're new everyday, old as the fall, the fall
   And I was born in the mess of it all

[V3]
 Every day, every way, every

[B1]
   Every cheap imitation
   All of my imagination
   Even my self-preservation
   Is yours in time</lyrics>
