<lyrics>[V1]
.           E
 In need of grace.
.           C#m
 In need of love.
.           A
 In need of mercy raining down
.           B
 From high above.
.           E
 In need of strength.
.           C#m
 In need of peace.
.           A
 In need of things
.          B               E
 That only You can give to me.

[C1]
.             A                   E
   In need of Christ, the perfect Lamb,
.  E                           B
   My refuge strong, the Great I AM.
.             E            B
   This is my song, my humble plea;
.            A      B        E
   I am Your  child, I am in need.</lyrics>
