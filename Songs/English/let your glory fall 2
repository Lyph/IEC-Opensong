<lyrics>[V1]
 A longing stirs in my soul
 Draws me near, calls me close
 Deeper into this love
 That won't run out, won't dry up

[P1]
   Oh, let it rain
   Oh, let it rain

[C1]
   Let Your glory fall
   Overwhelm my soul
   Let Your presence flood my life,
   O Lord

[V2]
 Deep is calling to deep
 Revival's tide breaking free
 Jesus, reign in this place
 Thirsty we cry, Heaven invade

[C2]
   Let Your glory fall
   Overwhelm my soul
   Let Your presence flood my life,
   O Lord
   Break upon me now
   Let Your love crash down
   Let Your glory fall
   Let Your glory fall

[P2]
   Oh, let it rain
   Oh, let it rain
   Oh, let it rain
   Oh, let it rain

[C3]
   Let Your glory fall
   Overwhelm my soul
   Let Your presence flood my life,
   O Lord
   Break upon me now
   Let Your love crash down
   Let Your glory fall
   Let Your glory fall</lyrics>
