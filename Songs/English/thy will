 I'm so confused
 I know I heard You loud and clear
 So, I followed through
 Somehow I ended up here

[P1]
   I don't wanna think I may never understand
   That my broken heart is a part of Your plan
   When I try to pray all I've got is hurt
   And these four words

[C1]
   Thy will be done
   Thy will be done
   Thy will be done

[V2]
 I know You're good
 But this don't feel good right now
 And I know You think
 Of things I could never think about

[P2]
   It's hard to count it all joy distracted by the noise
   Just trying to make sense of all Your promises
   Sometimes I gotta stop remember that You're God
   And I am not so

[C2]
   Thy will be done
   Thy will be done
   Thy will be done
   Like a child on my knees all that comes to me is
   Thy will be done
   Thy will be done
   Thy will

[B1]
   I know You see me, I know You hear me, Lord
   Your plans are for me Goodness You have in store
   I know You hear me, I know You see me, Lord
   Your plans are for me Goodness You have in store, so

[C3]
   Thy will be done
   Thy will be done
   Thy will be done
   Like a child on my knees all that comes to me is
   Thy will be done
   Thy will be done
   Thy will be done

[V3]
 I know You see me
 I know You hear me, Lordï»¿</lyrics>
