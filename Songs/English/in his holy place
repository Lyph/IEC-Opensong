 In his holy place, I will lift my hands
 And plead to my Lord
 In his sanctuary, I will kneel down
 And plead to my Lord
 Lord, who made the land and sky
 Purify each one of us
 Lord, who came and saved us
 Purify each one of us

[V2]
 In his holy place, I will lift my hands
 And glorify my Lord
 In his sanctuary, I will kneel down
 And glorify my Lord
 Lord, who made the land and sky
 Give to us your blessing
 Lord, who loved and saved us
 Give to us your blessing</lyrics>
