.G       D/F#  A          Bm
 You and me were meant to be
.G        D/F#          A     Bm
 A little lower than the angels.
.    G        D/F#  A       Bm
 And on this ground I have found,
.G        D/F#      A    Bm
 Finally found the reason:

[C1]
.          G D/F# ABm
   To sing glory,
.          G D/F# ABm
   To sing glory.

[V2]
.G       D/F#  A          Bm
 I long to walk hand in hand
.G        D/F#          A     Bm
 Down a golden road with Father,
.    G        D/F#  A       Bm
 Where choirs of angels praise His name.
.G        D/F#   ABm
 I want to learn:

[C2]
.          G D/F# ABm
   To sing glory,
.          G D/F# ABm
   To sing glory.
.          G D/F# A Bm
   And I can't find the words to say,
.          G D/F# A Bm
   Life gets in the way,
.           G D/F# A Bm
   Lord, You know my heart's desire.

[B1]
.          C                 B            Bb            D
   When it all comes down to who You are, words can not convey.
.          C                 B            Bb               D   D/ED/F#
   When it all comes down to who You are, words get in the way.

[B2]
.          C                 B            Bb               D   D/ED/F#G
   When it all comes down to who You are, words get in the way.</lyrics>
