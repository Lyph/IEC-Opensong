<lyrics>[V1]
 Look to the skies, there's a celebration
 Lift up your heads, join the angel song
 For our Creator becomes our Savior
 As a baby born!
 Angels, amazed, bow in adoration
 'Glory to God in the highest heaven!'
 Send the good news out to every nation
 For our hope has come

[C1]
   Worship the King - come, see His brightness
   Worship the King, His wonders tell
   Jesus our King is born today
   We welcome You, Emmanuel

[V2]
 Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God
 Father for ever, the Prince of Peace
 There'll be no end to Your rule of justice
 For it shall increase
 Light of Your face, come to pierce our darkness
 Joy of Your heart come to chase our gloom
 Star of the morning, a new day dawning
 Make our hearts Your home

[V3]
 Quietly He came as a helpless baby
 One day in power He will come again
 Swift through the skies He will burst with splendour
 On the earth to reign
 Jesus, I bow at Your manger lowly
 Now in my life let Your will be done
 Live in my flesh by Your Spirit holy
 Till Your kingdom comes</lyrics>
