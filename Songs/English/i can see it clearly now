<lyrics>[V1]
 I can see it clearly now
 There's a reason for this sound - It's Jesus
 At the core of who I am
 Is the risen son of man - It's Jesus

[P1]
   You're like no other for your love is greater
   And you are the centre of it all

[C1]
   It's all about you, It's all about you
   It's all about you, It's all about you

[V2]
 I exist to bring you praise
 And to shout no other name but Jesus

[B1]
   You are the first, You are the last
   You are my future
   'Cause you took my past
   You are the reason why I sing</lyrics>
