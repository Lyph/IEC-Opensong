.D           A           G         D
 Sing to the King who is coming to reign
.D        A         G             D
 Glory to Jesus the Lamb that was slain
.D           A           G            D
 Life and salvation, His empire shall bring
.D          A            G        D
 Joy to the nations when Jesus is King

[C1]
.  D
   Come let us sing a song
.    Em                          G
   A song declaring we belong to Jesus
.               D  C
   He's all we need
.  D
   Lift up a heart of praise
.  Em                             G
   Sing now with voices raised to Jesus
.              D
   Sing to the King

[V2]
.D         A          G            D
 For His returning we watch and we pray
.D          A         G            D
 We will be ready the dawn of that day
.D             A            G       D
 We'll join in singing with all the redeemed
.D        A              G        D
 Satan is vanquished and Jesus is King!</lyrics>
