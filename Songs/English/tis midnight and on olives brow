<lyrics>[V1]
 'Tis midnight, and on Olive's brow The star is dimmed that lately shone; 'Tis midnight, in the garden now The suff'ring Savior prays alone.

[V2]
 'Tis midnight, and from all removed Immanuel wrestles, lone, with fears; E'en the disciple whom He loved Heeds not his Master's grief and tears.

[V3]
 'Tis midnight, from the heav'nly plains Are borne the songs that angels know; Unheard by mortals are the strains That sweetly soothe the Savior's woe.</lyrics>
