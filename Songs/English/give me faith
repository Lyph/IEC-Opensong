<lyrics>[V1]
 I need You
 To soften my heart and break me apart
 I need You
 To open my eyes, to see that You're shaping my life

[P1]
   All I am, I surrender

[C1]
   Give me faith to trust what You say,
   That You're good and Your love is great
   I'm broken inside, I give You my life

[V2]
 I need You
 To soften my heart and break me apart
 I need You
 To pierce through the dark and cleanse every part of me

[B1]
   And I may be weak but Your Spirit's strong in me
   My flesh may fail, but my God, You never will</lyrics>
