. F     C      G  Am
 Led like a lamb to the slaughter
.    Fmaj7      G
 In  silence  and  shame.
.  F     C     G     Am
 There on Your back You carried a world
.  Fmaj7     G
 Of  violence  and  pain.
.    Dm    C      Dm   Gsus  G
 Bleeding,  dying,  bleeding,  dying.

   You're alive, You're alive, You have risen!
.      F    C    F    C    F    C  Dm
   Hallelujah! (Hallelujah!) (Hallelujah!)
.      F   C     Bb    C
   And the power and the glory is given,
.      F    C    F    C    F    C
   Hallelujah, (Hallelujah!) (Hallelujah!)

.F     C     G Am
 At break of dawn, poor Mary,
.    Fmaj7      G
 Still weeping she came,
.  F        C     G    Am
 When through her grief she heard Your voice
.   Fmaj7     G
 Now speaking her name:
. Dm  C     Dm    Gsus   G
 'Mary!' 'Master!' 'Mary!' 'Master!'

[V3]
.F     C    G Am
 At the right hand of the Father
.      Fmaj7   G
 Now seated on high
. F     C      G     Am
 You have begun Your eternal reign
.  Fmaj7       G
 Of  justice  and  joy.
.    Dm    C   Dm  Gsus  G
 Glory, glory, glory, glory!</lyrics>
