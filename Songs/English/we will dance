.  D
 Sing a song of celebration; lift up a shout of praise,
.                         G2                D
 For the Bridegroom will come, the Glorious One.
.    C2 G2                    D
 And oh, we will look on His face.
.      C2 G2                  D
 We'll go  to a much better place.

[V2]
.  D
 Dance with all your might; lift up your hands and clap for joy.
.                    G2                 D
 The time's drawing near when He will appear.
.     C2 G2                      D
 And, oh, we will stand by His side,
.    C2   G2             Asus  A
 A strong, pure spotless bride.

[C1]
.  D         C            G                 D
   We will dance on the streets that are golden,
.                 C             G           D
   The glorious Bride and the great Son of Man;
.               C          G         D          C  G
   From ev'ry tongue and tribe and nation will join
.                      D
   In the song of the Lamb.</lyrics>
