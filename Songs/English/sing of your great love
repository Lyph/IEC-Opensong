 All that is within me Lord will bless Your holy name

 I live my life to worship You alone

 You brought me out of darkness into Your glorious light

 Forever I will sing of Your great love

 Forever I will sing of Your great love

 I yearn to see all nations bow their knee

 To find Your love and everlasting peace

   Your trumpet will sound and all the heavens will know
.           G                   Bm
   That the time has finally come
.         G         D
   For the bride to take her place
.           G                A   G D
   And we'll hear the angels sing (angels sing)</lyrics>
