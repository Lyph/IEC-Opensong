 Your grace is enough, more than I need

 Draw near again, Let your Spirit make me new

.             D           G
   And I will worship you here

   Great is the love, Poured out for all

   This is our God, Lifted on high from death to life

   Forever our God is glorified, Servant and King
.              Bm          G      D
   Rescued the world, this is our God</lyrics>
