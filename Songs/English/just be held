.Am     F        C      G
 Hold it all together, everybody needs you strong,
.Am     F        C      G
 But life hits you out of nowhere and barely leaves you holding on
.Am   F      C         G
 And when you're tired of fighting, chained by your control
.Am    F       C        G
 There's freedom in surrender, lay it down and let it go

[V2]
 Chorus
.C                  G
 So when you're on your knees and answers seem so far away,
.Am               F
 You're not alone, stop holding on, and just be held,
.C              G
 Your world's not falling apart, it's falling into place
.Am              F
 I'm on the throne, stop holding on, and just be held
.C
 Just be held
.C     G
 Just be held

[V3]
.Am       F        C      G
 If your eyes are on the storm, you'll wonder if I love you still
.Am       F         C      G
 But if your eyes are on the cross, you know I always have and I always will
.Am      F         C        G
 And not a tear is wasted, in time you'll understand
.Am       F        C        G
 I'm painting beauty with the ashes, your life is in My hands

[V4]
 Repeat Chorus 1x

[V5]
 Bridge
.D            Am             C         F
 Lift your hands, lift your eyes, in the storm is where you'll find Me
.D          Am             C        F
 And where you are, I'll hold your heart, I'll hold your heart
.D     Am
 Come to Me, find your rest,
.C            Em
