<lyrics>[C1]
.  F                 Dm
   Go tell it on the mountain
.  Gm       Bb/C      F
   Over the hills and everywhere
.  F                 Dm
   Go tell it on the mountain
.       G9    Gm7       F
   That Jesus Christ is born

[V1]
.      F                    Dm7
 While shepherds kept their watching
.     Gm               F
 O'er silent flocks by night
.  F                   Dm7
 Behold throughout the heavens
.      G       F      C7
 There shone a holy light

[V2]
.    F                    Dm7
 The shepherds feared and trembled
.     Gm           F
 When lo above the earth
.     F             Dm7
 Rang out the angel chorus
.     G          F           C7
 That hailed our Savior's birth

[V3]
.     F          Dm7
 Down in a lowly manger
.    Gm                F
 The humble Christ was born
.    F              Dm7
 And God sent us salvation
.     G       F           C7
 That blessed Christmas morn</lyrics>
