.E                    A       E                     B
 Who is moving on the waters? Who is holding up the moon?
.E                       A        C#m                        B
 Who is peeling back the darkness, with the burning light of noon?
.E                      A         E                      B
 Who is standing on the mountains? Who is on the earth below?
.C#m           B        A       E        A           B    E
 Who is bigger than the heavens, and the Lover of my soul?

.E                       A      E                       B
 Who is He that makes me happy? Who is He that gives me peace?
.E                        A        C#m                        B
 Who is He that brings me comfort,  and turns the bitter into sweet?
.E                     A        E                    B
 Who is stirring up my passion?  Who is rising up in me?
.C#m            B     A       E     A            B    E
 Who is filling up my hunger,  with everything I need?

.  A                  C#m    B                      E

   And here on earth we gather, to declare Your name alone.</lyrics>
