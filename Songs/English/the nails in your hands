<lyrics>[V1]
.    G
 The nails in Your hands,
.    Em
 The nail in Your feet,
.     C                    D
 They tell me how much You love me;
.    G
 The thorns on Your brow,
.Em
 They tell me how,
.    C                     D
 You bore so much shame to love me.

[P1]
.               Bm            Em
   And when the heavens pass away,
.           Bm                 Em
   All Your scars will still remain,
.         Bm             Em               D
   And forever they will say how much You love me...

[C1]
   And I want to say,
.      G
   &quot;Forever my love,
.     Em
   Forever my heart,
.     C               D      G
   Forever my life is Yours.&quot; (2x)</lyrics>
