 VERSE 1:
 I take the bread of life
 Broken for all my sin
 Your body crucified
 To make me whole again

[V2]
 VERSE 2:
 I will recall the cup
 Poured out in sacrifice
 To trade this sinners' end
 For Your new covenant

[C1]
   CHORUS:
   Hallelujah
   I'll live my life in remembrance
   Hallelujah Your promise I won't forget

[V3]
 VERSE 3:
 I'll walk salvation's road
 With fear and trembling
 Your way borne as my own
 As Christ is formed in me

[C2]
   CHORUS:
   Hallelujah
   I'll live my life in remembrance
   Hallelujah
   Your promise I won't forget

[V4]
 POST CHORUS 1:
 If ever I should lose my way
 If ever I deny Your grace
 Remind me of the price You paid
 Hallelujah
 I'll live in remembrance

[V5]
 BRIDGE (repeated):
 You've been so so good to me
 You've been so so good to me
 Oh to think where I would be
 If not for You
 If not for You

[V6]
 POST CHORUS 2:
 As far as heights reach from the depths
 As far as east is from the west
 So far Your grace has carried me

[V7]
 POST CHORUS 3:
 Until I see You face to face
 Until at last I've won my race
 Remind me Youʼre not finished yet

[B1]
   TAG:
   Hallelujah
   Hallelujah
   Hallelujah
   I'll live in remembrance

[V8]
