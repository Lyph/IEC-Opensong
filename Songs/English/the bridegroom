 &quot;Until the day breaks and shadows flee
 Turn my beloved, and come to me
 I've made a place for you

[V2]
 I have come to the garden
 To find you here
 So let me see your face
 Let me hear your voice
 For your voice is sweet to me

[V3]
 Do you know that
 You have ravished my heart?
 Do you know that
 You have ravished my heart?
 Yes, you have ravished my heart
 With one glance of your eye

[V4]
 Now, the winter has passed
 The rain has been and gone
 I come over the hills to say
 'come away with me my dear, away,
 come away'

[V5]
 We will be, we will be, we will be together
 We will be, we will be, we will be forever

[V6]
 Would you lift up your eyes to see
 I am calling you now, to me
 I have so much more to tell you

[V7]
 All that you really believe inside
 What you see when you close your eyes
 I have so much more to show you&quot;</lyrics>
