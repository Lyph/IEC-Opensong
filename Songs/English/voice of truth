 Verse 1:
.F                                Dm
 Oh what i would do to have the kind of faith it takes to climb out of this
. Bb         Eb                 Bb
 Boat i'm in onto the crashing waves
.      F                       Dm
 To step out of my comfort zone into the realm of the unknown where
.   Bb              Eb              Bb
 Jesus is and he's holding out his hand

[V2]
.        C                Bb                   Fsus         F
 Wbut the aves are calling out my name and they laugh at me
.   C            Bb                 Fsus                 F
 Reminding me of all the Times i've tried before and failed
.     C                  Bb          Bb       C   Dm
 the waves they keep on telling me time and time again
.        Bbsus            C2
 &quot;boy you never win, you never win&quot;

[C1]
   Chorus:
.  F                  C
   But the voice of truth tells me a different story
.  Dm               Bbsus
   The voice of truth says &quot;Do not be afraid&quot;
.  F                  C
   And the voice of truth says &quot;This is for my glory&quot;
.  Dm                  Bbsus
   Out of all the voices calling out to me
.  Dm              Bbsus                             Fsus F
   I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth

[V3]
 Verse 2:
 Oh what i would do to have the kind of strength it takes to stand before a giant
 With just a sling and a stone
 Surrounded by the sound of a thousand warriors shaking in their armor wishing
 They'd have had the strength

[V4]
 To stand but the giants calling out my name and he laughs at me
 Reminding me of all times i've tried before and failed
 The giant keeps on telling me time and time again
 &quot;Boy, you never win, you never win&quot;</lyrics>
