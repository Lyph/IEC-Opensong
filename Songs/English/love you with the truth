 Verse 1:
.          Am             F
 For the longest time, I believed the lie
.         G        Em
 That Im not a strong enough believer
.       Am              F
 To be the friend that can take your hand
.  G            Em
 And lead you straight to Jesus
.            Am                F
 Im waiting on the preachers, singers, and the teachers
.         G        Em
 To string the perfect words together
.          Am             F
 But every single time I have to say goodbye
.     G           Em
 I wonder will this be the last time

[V2]
.     Dm           Am         G
 I cant call myself your friend and walk away

[C1]
   Chorus:
.     Am                     G
   When we love, we earn the right to speak the truth
.        Dm                   Am
   When we speak truth, we show the world we truly love
.             C               G
   Im not pointing my finger, Im holding out my hand
.                 Am                F
   I lay it all on the line now to see God save my friend

[V3]
.    Dm        Am      G
 Let my life and my words be the proof
.                 Am   F  G   Em

 Verse 2:
.       Am           F
 Yes, God is love, but God is just
.      G          Em
 And we are separated in our darkness
.     Am         F
 So God let Him who knew no sin
.      G       Em
 To become sin to make us right with Him
.          Am               F
 Its not about religion or earning Gods forgiveness
.     G         Em
 Or magic prayers or new behavior
.            Am                  F
 Its all about your heart, Hell meet you where you are
.        G           Em
 Turn from your sin and trust in Christ as Lord

[V5]
. Dm        Am              G
 Jesus is the truth, the life, the way

   When we speak truth, we show the world we truly love
.             C               G
   Im not pointing my finger, Im holding out my hand
.                 Am                F
   I lay it all on the line now to see God save my friend

   Bridge:
.  Dm     Am              C     G
   How Ive prayed for this moment, that you would finally see
.  Dm       Am          C           G
   That God is more than religion, a stained-glass fantasy
.  Dm       Am             C       G
   And how Ive prayed for the courage, for my silent faith to speak
.  Dm    Am             C      G
   Or that God would just send you a better friend than me

   Im not pointing my finger, Im holding out my hand

   I lay it all on the line now to see God save my friend
