.D               A/D  G   D/F#                G
 Lord, let Your glory fall as on that ancient day.
.Bm7        Dmaj7/F# G  Em7              G     D
 Songs of enduring   love, and then Your glory came.
.D        A/D     G  D/F#
 And as a sign to You
.                       G
 that we would love the same,
.Bm7            Dmaj7/F#   G   Em7             G     D
 Our hearts will sing that song; God, let Your glory come.

[C1]
.          D/F#                         G
   You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
.          D/F#                         G
   You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
.          Bm7           D/F#           G              D   G
   You are good, You are good, and Your love endures today.

[V2]
 Voices in unison
 giving You thanks and praise,
 Joined by the instruments and then Your glory came.
 Your presence like a cloud
 upon that ancient day.
 The priests were overwhelmed because Your glory came.

[V3]
 A sacrifice was made, and then Your fire came.
 They knelt upon the ground,
 and with one voice they praised. (2x)</lyrics>
