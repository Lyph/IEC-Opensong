 You can take my dry bones
 Breathe life into this skin
 You called me by name
 Raised me to life again

[V2]
 You can calm the oceans
 Speak peace into my soul
 Take me as I am
 Awaken my heart to beat again

[C1]
   Oh Jesus
   Oh Jesus
   Oh Jesus
   Alive in me

[V3]
 You move in the unseen
 You set the captives free
 As I stand and sing
 You're breaking the chains off me

[B1]
   Breathe in me Your life
   I can feel You are close now
   I can never hide
   You are here and You know me
   All I need is You
   And I love You
   I love You
   I love You
   I love You

[B2]
   Breathe in me Your life
   'Til Your love overtakes me
   Open up my eyes
   Let me see You more clearly
   Falling on my knees
   'Til I love like You love
   Like You love me
   I love You</lyrics>
