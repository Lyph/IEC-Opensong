.  Dm        C/E F2(no3)        C
   Shine for Me.  You shine for Me.

[C1]
.             D5
   I love you more than the sun
.          G2(no3)                    Bm

   You are mine, and you shine for me too.

   I love you more than the sun
.          G2(no3)                    Bm

   You are mine, and you shine for me too.
.            D5               G2(no3)                      Bm
   I love you yesterday and today, through the joy and the pain,
.                         A
   I'll say it again and again:

[B2]
.         G2(no3) Bm   D
   I love you     more.
.         G2(no3) Bm
   I love you     more.
.  D
    
.  G2(no3) Bm  D
    And I  see you, and I made you,
.  G2(no3) Bm   D.                     G      Bm
    And I  love you more than you can imagine,
.  D                 G
   More than you can fathom.
.  Bm D                  G   Bm
    I love you more than the sun,
.  D                G   BmD
   and you shine for Me.</lyrics>
