.D                  F#m7            Bm                   A
 We have nothing to get that didn't first come from your hand
.Gmaj9              D/F#            Em7             Asus A
 We have nothing to offer you which you did not provide__
.D                  F#m7                 Bm                A
 Every good perfect gift comes from your kind and gracious heart
.Gmaj9                 D/F#             Em7             Asus A
 And all we do is give back to you what always has been yours

   Lord we're breathing the breath that you gave us to breath
.             Bm7             Asus A
   To worship you, to worship you__
.             D            D/F#           Gmaj7
   And we're singing these songs with the very same breath
.             Bm7             G2
   To worship you, to worship you

 Who has given to you that it should be paid back to him?
.Gmaj9            D/F#          Em7        Asus A
 Who has given to you as if you needed anything?
.D               F#m7                Bm                 A
 From you and to you and through you come all things oh Lord
.Gmaj9                 D/F#             Em7             Asus A
 And all we do is give back to you what always has been yours

   We are breathing the breath that you gave us to breath</lyrics>
