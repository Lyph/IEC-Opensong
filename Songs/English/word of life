 Word of life speak to my weary heart
 Strengthen my broken parts lead me to Your open arms
 Word of truth illuminate all these lies
 The enemy speaks inside in freedom I will rise

[C1]
   'Cause You called me out from the grave
   So I can live like I've been changed
   There is a new song in my soul
   And it begins when I breathe in Your word of life

[V2]
 Spirit of God take me to a deeper place
 Take me out of what is safe i will not be afraid
 Spirit of God fill me with joy again
 Springing up from within it cannot be contained

[B1]
   The old has gone away
   Only Your love remains
   I am alive today
   'Cause You called me out</lyrics>
