.G                     C
 These are the days of Elijah,
.D             G           C
 Declaring the word of the Lord,
.    G                          C
 And these are the days of Your servant, Moses,
.D                   G
 Righteousness being restored.
.           Bm                          Em
 And though these are the days of great trials,
.   C                       D
 Of famine and darkness and sword,
.       G                       C
 Still, we are the voice in the desert crying,
.    Em7         D          G
 &quot;Prepare ye the way of the Lord!&quot;

[C1]
.  C         G                    C
   Behold He comes, riding on the clouds,
.                   G                  D
   Shining like the sun at the trumpet call.
.               G                           C
   So lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee,
.                    G        D      G
   And out of Zion's hill, salvation comes.

[V2]
.    G                     C
 And these are the days of Ezekiel,
.    D            G        C
 The dry bones becoming as flesh.
.    G                          C
 And these are the days of Your servant, David,
.   D           G         C
 Rebuilding the temple of praise.
.    Bm                        Em
 And these are the days of the harvest,
.    C                          D
 The fields are as white in the world.
.    G                   C
 And we are the laborers in Your vineyard,
.  Em          D           G
 Declaring the word of the Lord!

[B1]
.  G                            C
   There's no one like Jehovah, there's no one like Jehovah,
.  G                            D
   There's no one like Jehovah, there's no one like Jehovah.</lyrics>
