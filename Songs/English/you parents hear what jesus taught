 You parents, hear what Jesus taught When little ones to him were brought: Forbid them not, but heed my plea Permitting them to come to me.

[V2]
 Obey your Lord and let his truth Be taught your children in their youth That they in church and school may dwell And learn their Savior's praise to tell.

[V3]
 For if you love them as you ought, To Christ your children will be brought. If thus you place them in his care, All in your family well shall fare.</lyrics>
