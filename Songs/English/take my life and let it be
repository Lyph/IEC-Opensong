<lyrics>[V1]
.D                A/C#   D  Bm   G       D/A   A  D
 Take my life and let it be consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
.D       A/C#    G      D
 Take my moments and my days,
.D/F#     G    D/F# A/E       A
 Let them flow in   ceaseless praise,
.Bm       G       D/A  A    D
 Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

[V2]
.D                 A/C#     D    Bm     G       D/A A   D
 Take my hands and let them move at the impulse of  Thy love;
.D       A/C#     G        D
 Take my feet and let them be
.D/F#      G   D/F# A/E     A
 Swift and beauti___ful for Thee,
.Bm        G     D/A A   D
 Swift and beautiful for Thee.

.D                 A/C#   D    Bm      G     D/A A  D
 Take my voice and let me sing always, only, for my King;
.D       A/C#     G        D
 Take my lips and let them be
.D/F#        G  D/F# A/E      A
 Filled with messa___ges from Thee,
.Bm          G    D/A A    D
 Filled with messages from Thee.

[V4]
.D              A/C#   D     Bm    G          D/A A   D
 Take my silver and my gold: not a mite would I   withhold;
.D       A/C# G        D
 Take my intellect and use
.D/F#  G     D/F# A/E        A
 Every pow'r as   Thou shalt choose,
.Bm    G        D/A  A     D
 Every pow'r as Thou shalt choose.

[V5]
.D                A/C#    D    Bm     G        D/A A    D
 Take my love: my Lord, I pour at Thy feet its treasure store;
.D      A/C#     G      D
 Take myself and I will be
.D/F#  G D/F# A/E     A
 Ever, only,  all for Thee,
.Bm    G     D/A A   D
 Ever, only, all for Thee.

[V6]
.D                A/C#    D      Bm       G     D/A  A   D
 Take my will and make it Thine: it shall be no lon__ger mine;
.D       A/C#      G        D
 Take my heart: it is Thine own,
.D/F#     G  D/F# A/E   A
 It shall be Thy  royal throne,
.Bm       G      D/A A   D
 It shall be Thy ro__yal throne.</lyrics>
