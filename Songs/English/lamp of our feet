<lyrics>[V1]
 Lamp of our feet! whereby we trace Our path, when wont to stray; Stream from the fount of heav'nly grace! Brook by the trav'ler's way!

[V2]
 Bread of our souls! whereon we feed; True manna from on high! Our guide, and chart wherein we read Of realms beyond the sky.

[V3]
 Pillar of fire\through watches dark! Or radiant cloud by day! When waves would whelm our tossing bark\Our anchor and our stay!

[V4]
 Pole\star on life's tempestuous deep! Beacon! when doubts surround; Compass! by which our course we keep; Our deep sea\lead, to sound!

[V5]
 Riches in poverty! our aid In every needful hour! Unshaken rock! the pilgrim's shade; The soldier's fortress tow'r.

[V6]
 Our shield and buckler in the fight!
 Vict'ry's triumphant palm!
 Comfort in grief! in weakness, might!
 In sickness, Gilead's balm.

[V7]
 Childhood's preceptor! manhood's trust!
 Old age's firm ally!
 Our hope\-when we go down to dust,
 Of immortality.

[V8]
 Pure oracles of truth divine!
 Unlike each fabled dream
 Given forth from Delphos' mystic shrine
 Or groves of Academe!

[V9]
 Word of the ever-living God!
 Will of His glorious Son!
 Without Thee, how could earth be trod?
 Or Heaven itself be won?

[V10]
 Yet to unfold thy hidden worth,
 Thy mysteries to reveal,
 That Spirit which first gave thee forth,
 Thy volume must unseal!

[V11]
 And we, if we aright would learn
 The wisdom it imparts,
 Must to its heavenly teaching turn
 With simple, child-like hearts!</lyrics>
