<title>The Days Of Old</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Sunshine, beaches, endless summer days
 Adventures and holidays together
 Friends guitars and beaten up old cars
 Staying up all night just for fun
 See the morning come

[V2]
 At our table there's an empty chair
 Never again will you walk through my door
 Too late for farewells or a last goodbye
 One day your smile lit the world
 And then it's gone

[V3]
 And everywhere I go
 There's something that reminds me of you

[V4]
 So many pass beyond the grave before their time
 Our tears like rivers flow and fill the damns of grief
 Then slowly slowly we begin to live again
 A different life, no t like the Days of Old
 Your memory stirs me on to better things

[V5]
 Oh my God where are you now
 Do you see my tears? Have you heard my cry?
 I do not run this race alone
 This long dark night shall pass
 Your mercy come like the dawn

[V6]
 And everywhere I go
 There's something that reminds me of you

[V7]
 And everywhere I go
 There's something that reminds me of you

[V8]
 And everywhere I go
 There's something that reminds me of you

[V9]
 In the Days of Old

[V10]
 Sunshine, beaches, endless summer days
 Adventures and holidays together
 Friends guitars and beaten up old cars
 Staying up all night just for fun
 See the morning come

[V11]
 At our table there's an empty chair
 Never again will you walk through my door
 Too late for farewells or a last goodbye
 One day your smile lit the world
 And then it's gone

[V12]
 And everywhere I go
 There's something that reminds me of you

[V13]
 So many pass beyond the grave before their time
 Our tears like rivers flow and fill the damns of grief
 Then slowly slowly we begin to live again
 A different life, not like the Days of Old
 Your memory stirs me on to better things

[V14]
 Oh my God where are you now
 Do you see my tears? Have you heard my cry?
 I do not run this race alone
 This long dark night shall pass
 Your mercy come like the dawn

[V15]
 And everywhere I go
 There's something that reminds me of you

[V16]
 And everywhere I go
 There's something that reminds me of you

[V17]
 And everywhere I go
 There's something that reminds me of you</lyrics>
