<title>Your perfection, oh God, has no limits to me</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Your perfection, oh God, has no limits to me
 Every moment I live with You is a treasure.
 When I cry, when I'm weak You wash away all my tears,
 Flood my life with the faith that has no measures

[P1]
   I'm standing here to worship Your Glory,
   I'm not afraid to lift up my hands because You are worthy.

[C1]
   All sufficient God, give You all my praise.
   Overshadow me with Your holiness.
   Lord, I need Your strength and I need Your warmth
   There is nothing compares to Your, oh God, precious love.

[P2]
   I'm overwhelmed by Your beauty and Glory,
   I'm not afraid to lift up my praise because You are worthy</lyrics>
