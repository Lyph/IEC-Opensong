[V2]
 VERSE 1:
.H
 Behold the Father's heart
.   E
 The mystery He lavishes on us
.   G#m
 As deep cries out to deep
.H                   E
 Oh how desperately He wants us
.   G#m                  H
 The things of earth stand next to Him
.                   E
 Like a candle to the sun
.         G#m
 Unfailing Father
.        F#           E
 What compares to His great love

[V3]
 VERSE 2:
 Behold, His holy Son
 The Lion and the Lamb given to us
 The Word became a man
 That my soul should know its Saviour
 Forsaken for the sake of all mankind
 Salvation is in His blood
 Jesus, Messiah, the righteous died for love

[V4]
 Pre-chorus 1:

 How great Your love is, how great Your love is
.            H
 Then sings my soul

[V6]
 VERSE 3:
 Behold, I have a friend
 The Spirit breathing holy fire within
 My ever present help
 Speaking truth when I can't find it
 Light up this broken heart and light my way
 'Til my time on earth is done
 Oh, Holy Spirit
 Breathe in me like kingdom come

[V7]

 Oh Holy Spirit
 Let Your work in me be done

[V8]

 How great Your love is, how great Your love is

 OUTRO:
.             H         F#

 He who was and is to come
.           G#m            H        F#sus   F#
 Prepare the way until the work on earth is done
.              E            F#sus
 Watch as the clouds He rides swing low
.           G#m
 Lift up the sound as He makes
.              E
 Our praise His throne
.              H/F#                   H5
 Behold the Lord our God will lead us home.</lyrics>
