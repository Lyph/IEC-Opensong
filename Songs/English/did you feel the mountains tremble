 Do you feel the darkness tremble  when all the saints join in one song,
.Em7                                  Dsus
 And all the streams flow as one river

 to wash away our brokenness?_____

[P1]
.  D          G                     D
   And we can see that, God, You're moving,
.           G                   D
   A mighty river through the nations,
.                G                  D
   And young and old will turn to Jesus...
.  Em7                            G
   Fling wide, you heavenly gates;
.                         Asus  D   Asus D
   Prepare the way of the risen Lord.

[P2]
.  D           G                     D
   And here we see that, God, You're moving;
.            G            D
   A time of jubilee is coming,
.                 G               D
   When young and old return to Jesus...
.  Em7                            G
   Fling wide, you heavenly gates;
.                         Asus  D   Asus D
   Prepare the way of the risen Lord.

.  D                     G/B
   Open up the doors and let the music play.
.  Em7                          D       A7sus
   Let the streets resound with singing:

   Songs that bring Your hope and songs that bring Your joy,

   Dancers who dance upon injustice.</lyrics>
