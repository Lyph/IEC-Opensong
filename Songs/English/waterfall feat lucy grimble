 Everlasting One
 Nothing else compares
 To knowing You
 To knowing You

[V2]
 You're the living God
 And my soul it longs
 To be with You
 To be with You

[V3]
 Oh Lord Your love is like a waterfall
 Your love is like a flowing stream
 And whenever I'm feeling dry
 I come to the river, I come to the river of life

[V4]
 You are worthy Lord
 Of every song that I could sing
 That I could sing

[V5]
 And my heart cries out
 God I need You more than anything
 Than anything

[V6]
 As the deer pants for the water
 So my soul longs after You</lyrics>
