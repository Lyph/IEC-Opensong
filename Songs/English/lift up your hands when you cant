 [Verse 1]

[V2]
 Well I know that your heart is past broken
 And it feels like you got nothing left
 And you can't find your song cause you can't even speak
 You're just trying to take the next breath

[V3]
 [Verse 2]

[V4]
 And you find yourself here in this moment
 Where we have all gathered to praise
 And though you wish that you did you've got nothing to give
 It's enough that you're here anyway

[V5]
 [Chorus]

[V6]
 So let me stand up and sing of His goodness
 Let me lift up a song in your place
 Cause I know that He'll always be with us
 Even when we can't see His face
 I'm gonna sing to the One who is faithful

[V7]
 Though the battle is not over yet
 And I'll be your voice till you're able
 And I'll lift up your hands when you can't

[V8]
 [Verse 3]

[V9]
 One day I'll walk through the shadows
 Too weary and worn out to stand
 And I'm gonna need you beside me
 To lift up this song once again

[V10]
 [Chorus]

[V11]
 So let me stand up and sing of His goodness
 Let me lift up a song in your place
 Cause I know that He'll always be with us
 Even when we can't see His face
 I'm gonna sing to the One who is faithful

[V12]
 Though the battle is not over yet
 And I'll be your voice till you're able
 And I'll lift up your hands when you can't When you can't

[V13]
 [Bridge]

[V14]
 Hallelujah, we'll thank Him for all that He's done
 Hallelujah, we'll thank Him for what's yet to come
 Hallelujah, we'll thank Him for all that He's done
 Hallelujah, we'll thank Him for what's yet to come</lyrics>
