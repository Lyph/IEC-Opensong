<lyrics>[V1]
 I don't want to go

[V2]
 You changed my world when You came to me.
 You drove a passion, in my soul down deep,
 Lord, to follow You in everything.

[C1]
   I don't want to go somewhere if I know that You're not there,
   'Cause I know that me without You is a lie.
   And I don't want to walk that road, be a million miles from home,
   Cause my heart needs to be where You are. So I don't want to go.

[V3]
 So come whatever, i'll stick with You.
 (Whatever may come) (Right by Your side)
 I'll walk You'll lead me, call me crazy or a fool,
 For forever I promise You...

[C2]
   That I don't want to go somewhere if I know that You're not there,
   'Cause I know that me without You is a lie.
   And I don't want to walk that road, be a million miles from home,
   Cause my heart needs to be where You are. So I don't want to go

[B1]
   Without Your touch, without Your love
   Filling me like an ocean.
   For Your grace is enough, Enough for me.

[V4]
 Never want to go somewhere if I know that You're not there.
 No, no, no, no.

[C3]
   I don't want to go somewhere if I know that You're not there,
   'Cause I know that me without You is a lie.
   And I don't want to walk that road, be a million miles from home,
   Cause my heart needs to be right where You are. So I don't want to go.

[B2]
   Without Your touch, without Your love
   Filling me like an ocean.
   For Your grace is enough, Enough for me.
   Without Your touch, without Your love
   Filling me like an ocean.
   For Your grace is enough, Enough for me.</lyrics>
