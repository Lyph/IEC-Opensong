<lyrics>[V1]
.    D                Am
     I put my hope in You
.  C                               D
 I lay my life in the palm of Your hand
.    C               G
 For I am constantly drawn to You Lord
.   C                   A   1:DAmCG
 In ways I cannot comprehend

[V2]
.            D                   Am
 It's the Creator calling the created
.    C                   D
 The Maker beckoning the made
.          C                         G
 The bride finding what she's always waited for
.        C                   A  1:DAmCG
 When we find ourselves that day

[V3]
.        D                      Am
 It's no secret that we don't belong here
.      C                         D
 Those set apart by the grace of You
.       C                        G
 And we look for the day when we go to a place
.          C                    A  1:DAmCG
 Where the old becomes... brand new

[C1]
.     D                                 G
   In You where the hungry feast at the table
.            D                   G
   The blind frozen by colors in view
.                D                                 G
   The lame will dance, They'll dance for they are able
.          C
   And the weary find rest
.         A                  D  AmCG
   Oh the weary find rest in You</lyrics>
