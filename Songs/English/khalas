 Jesus paid the price for us
 Gave himself, a sacrifice
 To reconcile us back to God
 He shed his blood upon the cross

[C1]
   Khalas Khalas The battle's won
   Khalas Khalas Yes death is beaten!
   Khalas Khalas Sin's overcome
   Khalas Khalas Salvation's work is done!

[V2]
 Rescued and redeemed forgiven
 Now we are free from condemnation
 From Satan's power we have been saved
 When Jesus rose up from the grave!

[B1]
   // It is finished! //
   Salvations work is done</lyrics>
