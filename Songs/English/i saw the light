<lyrics>[V1]
 I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin.
 I wouldn't let my dear Saviour in.
 Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night.
 Praise The Lord, I saw the Light.

[C1]
   I saw the Light, I saw the Light,
   No more darkness, No more night.
   Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight.
   Praise the Lord, I saw the Light.

[V2]
 Just like the blind man, I wandered along,
 Worries and fears, I claimed for my own.
 Then like the blind man, that God, gave back his sight.
 Praise the Lord, I saw the Light.

[V3]
 I was a fool to wander and stray,
 For straight is the gate and narrow the way.
 Now I have traded, the wrong for the right.
 Praise the Lord, I saw the Light.</lyrics>
