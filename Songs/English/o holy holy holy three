<lyrics>[V1]
 O Holy, Blessed Trinity, Divine, Essential Unity, God Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Be Thou this day my Guide and Host.

[V2]
 My soul and body keep from harm, O'er all I have extend Thine arm, That Satan may not cause distress Nor bring me shame or wretchedness.

[V3]
 The Father's might shield me this day, The Son's pure wisdom cheer my way, The Holy Spirit's light divine Illume my heart's benighted shrine.

[V4]
 My Maker, strengthen Thou my heart, O my Redeemer, help impart, Blest Comforter, keep at my side That faith and love in me abide.

[V5]
 Lord, bless and keep Thou me as Thine; Lord, make Thy face upon me shine; Lord, lift Thy countenance on me And give me peace\sweet peace, from Thee.</lyrics>
