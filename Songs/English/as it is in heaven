[V2]
 God give us new ev'ry morning
 mercy as daily bread.
 In the name of Jesus,
 in the name of Jesus we pray.
 And lead us not to temptation,
 but deliver us with Your hand.
 In the name of Jesus,
 in the name of Jesus we pray.
 Father, we pray:

[B1]

   For the kingdom is Yours,
.          D
   And the power is Yours,
.          Em7             C2
   And the glory forever, amen. (4X)</lyrics>
