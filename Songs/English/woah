 Woah

[V2]
 Breaking off every chain and the fear that held me
 I refuse to agree with the lies they told me

[P1]
   I take up my position, speak to all my conditions
   Take the authority you won for me

[C1]
   The word of the Lord in my mouth
   To bring about the change
   Full of your power I step out
   Declare aloud Your praise

[V3]
 I Prophesy I Prophesy

[V4]
 I'm stepping up to become everything You've called me
 I believe in Your word and Your Spirit in me

[B1]
   I'll praise You like I've never known defeat
   I'll praise You every second You've redeemed
   I'll praise You, Your power rests on me
   I'll praise You now for every victory
   I'll praise You cause Your Spirit lives in me
   I'll praise You, Your power rests on me</lyrics>
