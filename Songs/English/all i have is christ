<lyrics>[V1]
 All I have is Christ

[V2]
 Verse 1:
 I once was lost in darkest night
 Yet thought I knew the way
 The sin that promised joy and life
 Had led me to the grave
 I had no hope that You would own
 A rebel to Your will
 And if You had not loved me first
 I would refuse You still

[V3]
 Verse 2:
 But as I ran my hell-bound race
 Indifferent to the cost
 You looked upon my helpless state
 And led me to the cross
 And I beheld God's love displayed
 You suffered in my place
 You bore the wrath reserved for me
 Now all I know is grace

[C1]
   Hallelujah all I have is Christ
   Hallelujah Jesus is my life

[V4]
 Verse 3:
 Now Lord I would be Yours alone
 And live so all might see
 The strength to follow Your commands
 Could never come from me
 O Father use my ransomed life
 In any way You choose
 And let my song forever be
 My only boast is You</lyrics>
