 Shouts, shouts of joy
 And victory resound in the tents
 Of the righteous of the Lord

[V2]
 Shouts of joy
 And victory resound in the tents
 Of the righteous of the Lord

[V3]
 The Lord's right hand
 Has done mighty things for us
 The Lord's right hand
 Is lifted high

[V4]
 The Lord's right hand
 Has done mighty things for us
 The Lord's right hand reigns on high
 The Lord's right hand reigns on high

[V5]
 Shouts of joy
 And victory resound in the tents
 Of the righteous of the Lord

[V6]
 Shouts of joy
 And victory resound in the tents
 Of the righteous of the Lord

[V7]
 The Lord's right hand
 Has done mighty things for us
 The Lord's right hand
 Is lifted high

[V8]
 The Lord's right hand
 Has done mighty things for us
 The Lord's right hand reigns on high
 The Lord's right hand reigns on high</lyrics>
