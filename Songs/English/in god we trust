 VERSE 1
.     Gmaj7
 Overwhelmed but I won't break
.           D
 Through the battle I will say
.     A
 Your grace will be enough
.     Hm
 Your grace will be enough
.     Gmaj7
 Under fire but we won't fall
.        D
 We will never be alone
.      A
 You'll always be enough
.      Hm         A
 You'll always be enough

 Now in God we trust

 I know God will not be shaken

 We will follow where You go
 We will trust through the unknown

 For we're carrying Your Name
 Your promise never fails
 Your promise never fails

 Our hope forever secure

 In You alone
