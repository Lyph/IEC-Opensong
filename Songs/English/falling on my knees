.E              C#m
 Hungry, I come to You
.      B        A
 For I know You satisfy
.E           C#m
 I am empty, but I know
.     B                 A
 Your love does not run dry

[P1]
.       B        A
   So I wait for You,
.       B        A
   So I wait for You

[C1]
.      E             A
   I'm falling on my knees
.  E               A
   Offering all of me
.  E                     A               E
   Jesus You're all this heart is living for

[V2]
 Empty, I come to You
 For Your arms are open wide
 I am weary, but I know
 Your touch restores my life</lyrics>
