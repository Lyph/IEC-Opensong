 We are living with &quot;hope in yourself&quot;
 We are living without faith and without love.
 But we cannot stop the time
 To extend the life

[V2]
 Jesus is the hope to live again
 He taught us to believe and love
 For us, He left the world of Heaven
 He died and rose again

[C1]
   Love did not die on the sinful Earth
   It resurrected on the third day
   And Love revived inside of me and inside of you
   Now this World warmed by it.

[V3]
 I dip into Him as in the sea
 I will put on white clothes
 And will spread my wings above the earth
 Jesus, be with me !</lyrics>
