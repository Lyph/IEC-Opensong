 Lord of all the earth
.      D               C2          D/C             C
 Would care to know my name, would care to feel my hurt?

 Who am I, that the

 Bright and Morning Star

 Who am I, that the
 eyes that see my sin
 Would look on me with love, and watch me rise again?
 Who am I, that the
 voice that calmed the sea
 Would call out through the rain, and calm the storm in me?

   A wave tossed in the ocean, a vapor in the wind.
   Still You hear me when I'm calling.
   Lord, You catch me when I'm falling.
