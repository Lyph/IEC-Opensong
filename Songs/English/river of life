. A   E    B7  E
 Down the mountain the river flows
.      A    E     B7      E
 And it brings refreshing wherever it goes.
.    A     E      B7      E
 Through the valleys and over the fields,
.     A   E     B7     E
 The river is rushing and the river is here.

[C1]
.       (E)          A     E
   The river of God sets our feet a-dancing,
.               B7       E
   The river of God fills our hearts with cheer;
.            A       E
   The river of God fills our mouths with laughter,
.     A     E      B7   E
   And we rejoice for the river is here.

[V2]
.    A    E     B7      E
 The river of God is teeming with life,
.    A     E     B7    E
 And all who touch it can be revived.
.    A    E     B7    E
 And those who linger on this river's shore
.      A      E      B7     E
 Will come back thirsting for more of the Lord.

[V3]
.A   E       B7    E
 Up to the mountain we love to go
.   A     E      B7    E
 To find the presence of the Lord.
.    A     E     B7     E
 Along the banks of the river we run,
.      A    E       B7      E
 We dance with laughter, giving praise to the Son.</lyrics>
