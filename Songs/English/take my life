.G        C          D         G
 How many times have I turned away?
.    C             G           D
 The number is the same as the sand on the shore.
.G     C            D        G
 Every time, you've taken me back,
.    C              D          G
 And now I pray you do it once more.

[C1]
.         G               C
   Please take from me my life,
.       Am               B
   When I don't have the strength
.     G        Am     D
   To give it away to you.
.         G               C
   Please take from me my life,
.       Am               B
   When I don't have the strength
.     C        Am          D G   GCDG
   To give it away to you, Jesus.

[V2]
.G        C          D       G
 How many times have I gone astray?
.    C             G           D
 The number is the same as the stars in the sky.
.G         C           D        G
 But every time you've taken me back,
.    C              D       G
 And now I pray you do it tonight.

[B1]
.     C        Am         D G   GCDGGCDG
   To give it away to you Jesus.</lyrics>
