<lyrics>[V1]
 Here and now I'm in the fire,
 In above my head
 Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh
 Being held under the pressure,
 Don't know what'll be left
 Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh
 But it's here in the ashes
 I'm finding treasure

[C1]
   He's making diamonds, diamonds
   Making diamonds out of dust
   He is refining in his timing
   He's making diamonds out of us

[V2]
 I'll surrender to the power
 Of being crushed by love
 Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh
 Till the beauty that was hidden
 Isn't covered up
 Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh
 Oh it's not what I hoped for
 It's something much better

[C2]
   He's making diamonds, diamonds
   Making diamonds out of dust
   He is refining in his timing
   He's making diamonds out of us

[B1]
   Oh the joy of the Lord
   It will be my strength
   When the pressure is on
   He's making diamonds
   Oh the joy of the Lord
   It will be my strength
   When the pressure is on
   He's making diamonds
   Oh the joy of the Lord
   It will be my strength
   When the pressure is on
   He's making, he's making

[C3]
   He's making diamonds, diamonds
   Making us rise up from the dust
   He is refining in his timing
   He's making diamonds out of dust
   Making diamonds out of us

[V3]
 I won't be afraid to shine
 I won't be afraid to shine
 I won't be afraid to shine
 Cause he's making diamonds out of dust
 Making diamonds out of usï»¿</lyrics>
