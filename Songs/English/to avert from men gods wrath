<lyrics>[V1]
 To avert from men God's wrath Jesus suffered in our stead; By an ignominious death He a full atonement made; And by His most precious blood, Brought us, sinners, nigh to God.

[V2]
 That we never should forget This great Love on us bestowed, He gave us His flesh to eat, and to drink His precious blood; All who sick and needy are May receive in Him a share.

[V3]
 Hither each afflicted soul May repair, though filled with grief; To the sick, not to the whole, the Physician brings relief; Fear not, therefore, but draw nigh, Christ will all your wants supply.

[V4]
 He who in self\righteousness Fixes any hope or stay, Has not on a wedding dress, And with shame is sent away; To the hungry, weary heart, He will food and rest impart.

[V5]
 But examine first your case, Whether you be in the faith; Do you long for pard'ning grace? Is your only hope His death? Then, howe'er your soul's oppressed, Come, you are a worthy guest.

[V6]
 He who Jesus' mercy knows, Is from wrath and envy freed;
 Love unto our neighbor shows That we are His flock indeed;
 Thus we may in all our ways Show forth our Redeemer's praise.</lyrics>
