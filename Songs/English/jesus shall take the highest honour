<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus shall take the highest honour
 Jesus shall take the highest praise
 All earth join heaven in exalting
 The Name which is above all other names

[V2]
 Let's bow the knee in humble adoration
 For at His Name, every knee shall bow
 Let every tongue confess,
 He is Christ God's only son,
 Sovereign Lord, we give You glory now

[V3]
 For all honour and blessing and power
 Belongs to You, belongs to You
 All honour and blessing and power
 Belongs to You, belongs to You
 Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God.</lyrics>
