<lyrics>[V1]
 Hear the Word, roaring as thunder
 With a new, future to tell
 For the dry, season is over
 There is a cloud, beginning to swell

[V2]
 To the skies, heavy with blessing
 Lift your eyes, offer your heart
 Jesus Christ, opened the Heavens
 Now we receive, the Spirit of God

[C1]
   We receive Your rain
   We receive Your rain

[V3]
 Every seed, buried in sorrow
 You will call, forth in its time
 You are Lord, Lord of the harvest
 Calling our hope, now to arise

[C2]
   We receive Your rain
   We receive Your rain
   We receive Your rain
   We receive Your rain

[B1]
   Like a flood; like a flood
   We receive Your love, when You come
   Like a flood; like a flood
   We receive Your love, when You come
   Like a flood; like a flood
   We receive Your love, when You come
   Like a flood; like a flood
   We receive Your love!

[V4]
 And with great, anticipation
 We await, the Promise to come
 Everything, that You have spoken
 Will come to pass, let it be done!

[C3]
   We receive Your rain
   We receive Your rain
   We receive Your rain
   We receive Your rainï»¿</lyrics>
