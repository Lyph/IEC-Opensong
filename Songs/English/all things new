<lyrics>[V1]
.G                               C
 Blue skies that take me back to being a child.
.G                               C
 Trees with leaves that turn the colors I love.
.G                              C
 A heart that's beating to Your melodies ringing...
.Am*        C                           D
 And I am a miracle, 'cause heaven is a part of me,
.C
 And You are the song that I'm singin'.</lyrics>
