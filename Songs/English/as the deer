.C      G          Am      F
 As the deer pants for the water,
.      Dm         G     C
 So my soul longs after You.
.C     G          Am        F
 You alone are my heart's desire
.      Dm      G       C
 And I long to worship You.

[C1]
.  Am               F            C
   You alone are my strength, my shield,
.      F               Dm     E
   To You alone may my spirit yield.
.  C    G           Am         F
   You alone are my heart's desire

   And I long to worship You.

[V2]
.C      G             Am      F
 I want You more than gold or silver,

 Only You can satisfy.

 You alone are the real joy-giver

 And the apple of my eye.

[V3]
.C         G              Am      F
 You're my Friend and You are my Brother,
.     Dm         G     C
 Even though You are a King.
. C     G             Am  F
 I love You more than any other,
.        Dm        G     C
 So much more than anything.</lyrics>
