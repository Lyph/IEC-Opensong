 Your singing moves and shakes the ground
 Your beckon brings the rain in drought
 Your glory spins the earth around
 And Your whisper makes Your fire fall down

[P1]
   There's no other name
   The Name that stands through the ages

[C1]
   There's no other name, there's no other name like Yours
   Jesus like Yours Jesus
   There's no other name, there's no other name like Yours
   Jesus, like Yours Jesus

[V2]
 Your word commands the wind and waves
 Your touch revives the sick and lame
 Your power wakes the dead again
 And Your love destroys the grip of sin
 For Your love destroys the grip of sin

[C2]
   There's no other name, there's no other name like Yours
   Jesus like Yours Jesus
   There's no other name, there's no other name like Yours
   Jesus, like Yours Jesus

[B1]
   Every knee will bow, every tongue confess
   The Name of Jesus
   Every knee will bow and every tongue confess
   The Name of Jesus
   Oh every knee will bow every tongue confess
   The Name of Jesus
   Oh every knee will bow and every tongue confess
   The Name of Jesus

[C3]
   There's no other name, there's no other name like Yours
   Jesus like Yours Jesus
   There's no other name, there's no other name like Yours
   Jesus, like Yours Jesus

[V3]
