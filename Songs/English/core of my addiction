 I'm aching, transparent.
 Your eyes see right through me.
 I'm dependent and shaking,
 I'm falling to my knees.

[P1]
   And I can't contain this.
   You're the only one I need.
   I'm hooked and I cannot hide it.
   Your love's controlling me.

[C1]
   You're the core of my addiction.
   I want to live, want to lose myself in You.
   You're the heart of my obsession.
   I want to live, but I would die for You.
   I'm addicted.

[V2]
 Impulsive, enraptrued,
 This yearning's captured me.
 I'm determined, I'm not pretending.
 You are my destiny.

[P2]
   I can feel the freedom.
   You're the only one I need.
   I'm alive and finally breathing.
   You're my recovery.

[B1]
   God, I've waited for this day.
   I'll never run away.
   And You won't have to chase me.

[B2]
   I'm addicted
   I'm addicted to You.</lyrics>
