<title>Shepherd Of My Soul</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Lord of the mountains and sea
 You are treading a path set for me
 God of the seasons and sky
 You have always been holding my life

[V2]
 And Lord, You are the shepherd of my soul
 So I lay down my plans, I give up my rights
 And let You take control of this surrendered life

[V3]
 So I put my trust in the one
 Who created the stars and the sun
 You are eternally kind
 Always faithful and endlessly wise

[V4]
 You comfort, You sustain
 In shaking You remain
 Unmoved and unafraid
 Forever and always
 You lead me by still waters
 Lead me through the valleys
 Lead me in Your wisdom
 Shepherd of my soul

[V5]
 Through valleys of shadow and death I am not afraid
 By my Father's breath every star in the sky was made
 And who can I fear when You're standing right here by my side?
 Always leading, protecting and guarding my left and my right

[V6]
 Father You make all things new
 Great God of creation
 Father You will always be my rock and salvation</lyrics>
