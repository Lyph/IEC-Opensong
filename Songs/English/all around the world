.  E                              D       A
   All around the world there's a new day dawning,
.            E                             D        A
   There's a sound coming round, there's a new song rising up,
.  D   A
   Ah, it's a new day!
.  EDA
    
.  E                         D         A
   Everywhere you go you can hear this story,
.            E                            D          A
   There's a power coming down, there's a glimpse of glory now,
.  D   A              EDA
   Ah, it's a new day!

[V1]
.Bm7                        F#m                    EEsusE
 There's a sound of praise, There's a sound of war;
.Bm7                   F#m               E
 Lift the banner high, let the Lion roar.
.Bm7                    F#m                E     EsusE
 Can you hear the sound in the tops of the trees?
.F#m                  D                BsusB
 Heaven's armies come! Crush the enemy!

[V2]
.E              Esus             EEsesE
 Lift your hands before the King,
.              Esus               B7susBE
 The sovereign Ruler of the earth;
.        Esus                EsusE
 Let the nations come to Him,
.E           Esus               D/AAD/AA
 Let the cry of hearts be heard:
.  D/A  A     D/A  A     D/A  A   Bsus
 Revive us! Revive us! Revive us again!

[V3]
.Bm7                       F#m       EEsus4E
 Let the lame run, let the blind see!
.Bm7                      F#m               E
 Let Your power come, set the captives free!
.Bm7                        F#m                EEsus4E
 Let the lost return to the Lover of our souls,
.Bm7                   D                 BsusB
 Let the prodigal find the way back home.</lyrics>
