<lyrics>[V1]
.      G          D
 You are beautiful beyond description,
.    C     G
 Too marvellous for words,
.           D
 Too wonderful for comprehension,
.       C          D  B7
 Like nothing ever seen or heard.
.     Em        A
 Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom?
.      Am7          D
 Who can fathom the depth of Your love?
.       G          D
 You are beautiful beyond description,
.    C  Dsus  D G   C   D
 Majesty, enthroned above.

.        G   D    C
   And I stand, I stand in awe of You.
.     G    D      C
   I stand, I stand in awe of You.
.      B7         Cmaj7    A
   Holy God, to whom all praise is due,
.     Am7   D      C G
   I stand in awe of You.</lyrics>
