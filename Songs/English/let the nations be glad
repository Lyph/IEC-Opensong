<lyrics>[V1]
 From the north to the south
 From the east and the west
 Lord Your name will be praised
 Throughout all of the earth

[V2]
 Every tribe, every tongue
 They will come and bow down
 And confess &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot;
 The great King over all

[C1]
   // Let the nations be glad, be glad, be glad in our God //

[V3]
 Every age, every race
 Will rejoice in God's grace
 They will sing and proclaim
 That our God is the God who reigns !

[B1]
   // The whole earth, the whole earth, the whole earth
   Is full of Your glory, //
   Is full of Your glory,
   ...as the waters cover the sea</lyrics>
