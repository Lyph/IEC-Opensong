 VERSE 1
 Fate
 Holds nothing on the providence I know
 No longer bound to things of wood and stone
 When all I had to offer was my worst
 You saw my heavy heart and loved me first

[V2]
 Your beauty staring down my brokenness
 You chose to throw Your heart into the mess
 Compassion crashing down upon my debt You were there

[V3]
 PRE-CHORUS 1
 All this time
 Like a river running through my failure
 You carried me all this time
 Like the splinters buried in
 Your shoulders You carry me now

[V4]
 CHORUS 1
 Hallelujah
 If ever now my heart cries hallelujah
 If ever now in the wonder of Your grace
 A thousand times a thousand years my soul
 Will say

[V5]
 VERSE 2
 Grace
 You saw the crushing weight my flesh deserved
 You kneeled and wrote forgiveness in the dirt
 And one by one the stones fell where they lay
 As one by one my accusers walked away
 With nothing left to throw they made a cross
 And knowing only love could count the cost
 You were there

[V6]
 PRE-CHORUS 2
 All this time
 Like a river running through my failure
 You carried me all this time
 Like the splinters buried in
 Your shoulders Your love carried all my shame
 Jesus how my soul will praise You
 You carried me all this way
 Like a diamond in the scars upon
 Your crown You carry me now

[V7]
 CHORUS 2
 Hallelujah
 If ever now my heart cries hallelujah
 If ever now in the wonder of Your grace
 A thousand times a thousand years
 My soul will say
 Hallelujah
 Forever now in the greatness of my Saviour
 Forever now in the brightness of
 Your Name Jesus on this rock I'll sing Your praise</lyrics>
