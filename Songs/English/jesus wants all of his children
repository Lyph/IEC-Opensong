<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus wants all of His children to be good and true; He will help if we but ask Him, help us gladly too.

[V2]
 Jesus was so meek and lowly, As a little child. We will try to be like Jesus, gentle, patient, mild.

[V3]
 Jesus wants us to be loving, helping when we may. We will try to be kindhearted, merciful each day.

[V4]
 &quot;Blessed are the pure in heart,&quot; thus the Savior taught. Clean in mind, in soul, in body, pure in every thought.

[V5]
 When we find our friends are angry, we will to them say, &quot;Jesus wants you to be loving, each and every day.&quot;

[V6]
 When I know that I have done wrong, to Jesus I flee.
 He has paid for all transgressions, He has paid for me!

[V7]
 Jesus knew that we would fail Him so He came to be
 Life to all the poor and lost ones, life eternally!</lyrics>
