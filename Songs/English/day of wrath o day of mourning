<lyrics>[V1]
 Day of wrath, O day of mourning! See fulfilled the prophet's warning, Heav'n and earth in ashes burning.

[V2]
 Oh, what fear man's bosom rendeth When from Heav'n the Judge descendeth On whose sentence all dependeth!

[V3]
 Wondrous sound the trumpet flingeth, Through earth's sepulchers it ringeth, All before the throne it bringeth.

[V4]
 Death is struck and nature quaking; All creation is awaking, To its Judge an answer making.

[V5]
 Lo, the book, exactly worded, Wherein all hath been recorded; Thence shall judgment be awarded.

[V6]
 When the Judge His seat attaineth And each hidden deed arraigneth, Nothing unavenged remaineth.

[V7]
 What shall I, frail man, be pleading? Who for me be interceding When the just are mercy needing?

[V8]
 King of majesty tremendous, Who dost free salvation send us, Fount of pity, then befriend us.

[V9]
 Think, good Jesus, my salvation Caused Thy wondrous incarnation; Leave me not to reprobation!

[V10]
 Faint and weary Thou hast sought me, On the cross of suff'ring bought me; Shall such grace be vainly brought me?

[V11]
 Righteous Judge, for sin's pollution
 Grant Thy gift of absolution
 Ere that day of retribution!

[V12]
 Guilty, now I pour my moaning,
 All my shame with anguish owning:
 Spare, O God, Thy suppliant groaning!

[V13]
 From that sinful woman shriven,
 From the dying thief forgiven,
 Thou to me a hope hast given.

[V14]
 Worthless are my prayers and sighing;
 Yet, good Lord, in grace complying,
 Rescue me from fires undying.

[V15]
 With Thy favored sheep, oh, place me!
 Nor among the goats abase me,
 But to Thy right hand upraise me.

[V16]
 While the wicked are confounded,
 Doomed to flames of woe unbounded,
 Call me, with Thy saints surrounded.

[V17]
 Low I kneel with heart submission, See, like ashes,
 my contrition; Help me in my last condition!

[V18]
 Day of sorrow, day of weeping, When, in dust no
 longer sleeping, Man awakes in Thy dread keeping!</lyrics>
