<lyrics>[C1]
   Rejoice! Rejoice!
   Christ is in you
   The hope of glory
   In our hearts
   He lives! He lives!
   His breath is in you
   Arise a mighty army
   We arise

[V1]
 Now is the time for us
 To march upon the land
 Into our hands
 He will give the ground we claim
 He rides in majesty
 To lead us into victory
 The world shall see
 That Christ is Lord

[V2]
 God is at work in us
 His purpose to perform
 Building a kingdom
 Of power not of words
 Where things impossible
 By faith shall be made possible
 Let's give the glory
 To Him now.

[V3]
 Though we are weak, His grace
 Is everything we need
 We're made of clay
 But this treasure is within
 He turns our weaknesses
 Into His opportunities
 So that the glory
 Goes to Him</lyrics>
