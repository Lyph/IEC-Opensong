<title>At the Cross</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Alas! and did my Savior bleed?
 And did my Sov'reign die?
 Would He devote that sacred head
 For such a worm as I?

[C1]
   At the cross, at the cross,
   Where I first saw the light,
   And the burden of my heart rolled away -
   It was there by faith I received my sight,
   And now I am happy all the day.

[V2]
 Was it for crimes that I have done
 He groaned upon the tree?
 Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
 And love beyond degree!

[V3]
 Well might the sun in darkenss hide
 And shut its glories in,
 When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
 For man the creature's sin.

[V4]
 Thus might I hide my blushing face
 While His dear cross appears;
 Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
 And melt mine eyes to tears.

[V5]
 But drops of grief can ne'er repay
 The debt of love I owe:
 Here, Lord, I give myself away -
 'Tis all that I can do!</lyrics>
