<title>Grace Alone</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 I was an orphan, lost at the fall
 Running away when I'd hear You call
 But Father, You worked Your will
 I had no righteousness of my own
 I had no right to draw near Your throne
 But Father, You loved me still

[V2]
 And in love, before You laid the world's foundation
 You predestined to adopt me as Your own
 You have raised me up so high above my station
 I'm a child of God by grace, and grace alone

[V3]
 You left Your home to seek out the lost
 You knew the great and terrible cost
 But Jesus, Your face was set
 I worked my fingers down to the bone
 But nothing I did could ever atone
 But Jesus, You paid my debt

[V4]
 By Your blood I have redemption and salvation
 Lord You died that I might reap what You have sown
 And You rose that I might be a new creation
 I am born again by grace, and grace alone

[V5]
 I was in darkness all of my life
 I never knew the day from the night
 But Spirit, You made me see
 I swore I knew the way on my own
 Head full of rocks, a heart made of stone
 But Spirit, You moved in me

[V6]
 And At Your touch my sleeping spirit was awakened
 On my darkened heart the light of Christ has shone
 Called into a Kingdom that cannot shaken
 Heaven's citizen by grace, and grace alone

[V7]
 So I'll stand in faith by grace, and grace alone
 I will run the race by grace, and grace alone
 I will slay my sin by grace, and grace alone
 I will reach the end by grace, and grace alone</lyrics>
