<lyrics>[V1]
 Everybody falls sometimes
 Gotta find the strength to rise
 From the ashes and make a new beginning
 Anyone can feel the ache
 You think it's more than you can take
 But you are stronger, stronger than you know

[P1]
   Don't you give up now the sun will soon be shining
   You gotta face the clouds to find the silver lining

[C1]
   I've seen dreams that move the mountains
   Hope that doesn't ever end
   Even when the sky is falling
   And I've seen miracles just happen
   Silent prayers get answered
   Broken hearts become brand new
   That's what faith can do

[V2]
 It doesn't matter what you've heard
 Impossible is not a word
 It's just a reason for someone not to try
 Everybody's scared to death
 When they decide to take that step
 Out on the water it'll be alright

[P2]
   Life is so much more than what your eyes are seeing
   You will find your way if you keep believing

[C2]
   I've seen dreams that move the mountains
   Hope that doesn't ever end
   Even when the sky is falling
   And I've seen miracles just happen
   Silent prayers get answered
   Broken hearts become brand new
   That's what faith can do

[B1]
   You don't have a chance
   (That's what faith can do)
   When the world says you can't
   It'll tell you that you can!

[C3]
   I've seen dreams that move the mountains
   Hope that doesn't ever end
   Even when the sky is falling
   And I've seen miracles just happen
   Silent prayers get answered
   Broken hearts become brand new
   That's what faith can do
   That's what faith can do!
   Even if you fall sometimes
   You will have the strength to rise</lyrics>
