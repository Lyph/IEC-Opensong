<lyrics>[V1]
 Through the night of doubt and sorrow Onward goes the pilgrim band, Singing songs of expectation, Marching to the Promised Land. Clear before us through the darkness Gleams and burns the guiding light: Brother clasps the hand of brother, Stepping fearless through the night.

[V2]
 One the light of God's own presence, O'er His ransomed people shed, Chasing far the gloom and terror, Bright'ning all the path we tread: One the object of our journey, One the faith which never tires, One the earnest looking forward, One the hope our God inspires.

[V3]
 One the strain that lips of thousands Lift as from the heart of one; One the conflict, one the peril One the march in God begun: One the gladness of rejoicing On the far eternal shore, Where the One Almighty Father Reigns in love for evermore.

[V4]
 Onward, therefore, pilgrim brothers, Onward, with the cross our aid! Bear its shame, and fight its battle, Till we rest beneath its shade. Soon shall come the great awaking, Soon the rending of the tomb; Then the scatt'ring of all shadows, And the end of toil and gloom.</lyrics>
