.A            D             E          A
 Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise,
.    D           E             F#m
 The city of our God, the holy place,
.    A                 Bm   Esus4  E
 The joy of the whole earth.
.A            D               E             A
 Great is the Lord in whom we have the victory,
.   D       E              F#m
 He aids us against the enemy,
.   A               Bm   Esus4  E
 We bow down on our knees.

[C1]
.      A                                  C#m
   And Lord, we want to lift your name on high,

   And Lord, we want to thank you,

   For the works you've done in our lives,
.      A                                C#m
   And Lord, we trust in your unfailing love,
.      D                 A
   For you alone are God eternal,
.    Bm                  E       A
   Throughout earth and heaven above.</lyrics>
