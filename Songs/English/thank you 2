 [Verse 1]
 How do I say thank You, Lord
 For the way that You love, and the way that You come
 For all that You've done, and all that You'll do
 My heart pours out, thank You

[V2]
 [Chorus 1]
 You don't have to come, but You always do
 You show up in splendor and change the whole room
 You don't have to come, but You always do
 You show up in splendor and change the whole room

[V3]
 [Verse 2]
 How do I say thank You, Lord
 For the life that You gave, the cross that You bore
 For the love You poured out to ransom my soul
 My heart pours out, this thankful song

[V4]
 [Chorus 1]
 You don't have to come, but You always do
 You show up in splendor and change the whole room
 You don't have to come, but You always do
 You show up in splendor and You change the whole room

[V5]
 [Bridge]
 You walked through all of my walls
 Conquered my shame
 Stepped into my past
 Filled my world with grace
 You didn't have to come, but You wanted to

[V6]
 You walked through all of my walls
 Conquered my shame
 Stepped into my past
 Filled my world with grace
 You didn't have to come, but You wanted to

[V7]
 [Chorus 2]
 You don't have to come, but You always do
 You're right here in Your splendor, standing in this room
 I see the fire in Your eyes, I see the mercy in Your smile
 I feel the fury of Your love all around us

[V8]
 [Chorus 1]
 'Cause You don't have to come, but You always do
 You show up in splendor and You change the whole room
 You don't have to come, but You always do
 You show up in splendor and You change the whole room

[V9]
 [Outro]
 There's a King in the room
 With fire in His eyes
 And redemption in His heart</lyrics>
