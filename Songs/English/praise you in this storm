.Em            C2(no3)
 I was sure by now
.                           G
 God You would have reached down
.              D/F#
 And wiped our tears away
.                Em7
 Stepped in and saved the day
.          C2(no3)        G
 But once again I'll say Amen
.                  D
 And it's still rainin'

[P1]
.  Am                      C2(no3)
   As the thunder rolls, I barely hear You whisper
.              Em         Dsus  D
   Through the rain I'm with You
.      Am                       C2(no3)
   And as Your mercy falls, I'll raise my hands
.                           G              D
   And praise the God who gives and takes away

[C1]
.  Em                          C2(no3)
   And I'll praise You in this storm
.                      G
   And I will lift my hands
.                      D                     Em
   For You are who You are no matter where I am
.                        C
   And ev'ry tear I've cried
.                    G                     D/F#
   You hold in Your hand You never left my side
.                          Am
   And though my heart is torn
.  C2(no3)                     G  Bm7
   I will praise You in this storm

[V2]
 I remember when
 I stumbled in the wind
 You heard my cry to You
 And raised me up again
 But my strength is almost gone
 How can I carry on
 If I can't find You

[B1]
.  Am7
   I lift my eyes unto the hills
.  C
   Where does my help come from
.  G
   My help comes from the Lord
.      Bm7
   The Maker of heaven and earth</lyrics>
