<lyrics>[V1]
.G               D             G                     D
 Joyful, joyful, we adore You, God of glory, Lord of light;
.G              D                 G                    D    G
 Angels lifting praise before You Sing throughout this holy night.
.D    G      D      G    D        G     Em  A  D
 In a manger lies a Baby Child of Mary, Son of God.
.G                D             G                   D       G
 Voices joined in joyful chorus Praise You for Your gift of love.

[V2]
.G                D             G                     D
 All Your works declare Your glory; All creation joins to sing.
.G                  D              G               D           G
 Praise resounds as earth rejoices In the birth of Christ, the King.
.D         G       D        G       D        G         Em  A     D
 Shepherds kneel before the Infant. Trumpets sound and an__thems raise
.G               D                  G                 D         G
 As with joy our hearts are lifted, Joined in wonder, love, and praise.</lyrics>
