.     G             D/F#
 Give thanks with a grateful heart
.     Em            Bm
 Give thanks to the Holy One
.     C                   G          F Em         D
 Give thanks because He's given Jesus Christ, His Son

[C1]
.      Bm          Em              Am
   And now let the weak say, &quot;I am strong&quot;
.          D7              Bm
   Let the poor say, &quot;I am rich&quot;
.          Em                   F        Dsus
   Because of what the Lord has done for us&quot;
.       G
   Give Thanks</lyrics>
