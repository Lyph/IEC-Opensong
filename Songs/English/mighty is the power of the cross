<lyrics>[V1]
 What can take a dying man
 And raise him up to life again?
 What can heal a wounded soul?
 What can make us white as snow?
 What can fill the emptiness?
 What can mend our brokenness,
 Brokenness?

[C1]
   Mighty, awesome, wonderful
   Is the holy cross,
   Where the Lamb laid down His life
   To lift us from the fall.
   Mighty is the power of the cross.

[V2]
 What restores our faith in God?
 What reveals the Father's love?
 What can lead the wayward home?
 What can melt a heart of stone?
 What can free the guilty ones?
 What can save and overcome,
 Overcome?

[B1]
   It's a miracle to me.
   (It's a miracle to me.)
   And it's still a mystery.
   (And it's still a mystery.)
   It's a miracle to me,
   The power of God
   For those who believe.

[C2]
   Mighty, awesome, wonderful
   Is the holy cross,
   Where the Lamb laid down His life
   To lift us from the fall.

[B2]
   Mighty is the power of,
   Mighty is the power of,
   Mighty is the power of the cross.</lyrics>
