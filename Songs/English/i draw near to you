<title>I Draw Near to You</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 I draw near to you
 I have strayed from your ways
 Do not leave me in my shame
 My Lord and my God

[V2]
 You are my Lord God
 My King and my Master

[V3]
 Teach me your paths
 Give me your direction
 Put to death my selfishness
 My Lord and my God

[V4]
 My hope is in you
 My rebellion is with you
 Your great mercy is on me
 My Lord and my God</lyrics>
