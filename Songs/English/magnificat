<lyrics>[V1]
 My soul shall magnify the Lord, And with my spirit I rejoice; My Savior has regard for me, He hears His lowly servant's voice.

[V2]
 Behold, I am forever blessed, For God has done great things for me; His mercy rests on those who fear, Who honor His Name most holy.

[V3]
 The Lord has shown His mighty arm, Those proud in heart He shall put down; The haughty from their thrones removed, The lowly have God's blessing found.

[V4]
 The hungry with good things are filled, They see God's kindness ev'ry day; But on the rich no blessing rests, With empty hands they're sent away.

[V5]
 The Lord helps His beloved ones, In mercy He His cov'nant keeps; Just as He promised long ago, to Abraham, and to his Seed.</lyrics>
