<lyrics>[V1]
.C          F/C        C
 Wonderful, merciful Savior,
.Em       F            G
 Precious Redeemer and Friend,
.Am            G           F
 Who would have thought that a lamb could
.C/G          G     Am   F
 Rescue the souls of men;
.       C/G           G   C     Bm
 Oh, You rescue the souls of men.

[V2]
 Counselor, Comforter, Keeper,
 Spirit we long to embrace.
 You offer hope when our hearts have
 Hopelessly lost the way;
 Oh, we've hopelessly lost the way.

[C1]

   You are the One that we praise.
.  Am         G       F    G
   You are the One we adore.
.  Am          G          F
   You give the healing and grace our
.  C/G          G      Am   F
   Hearts always hunger for;
.            C/G         G   C
   Oh, our hearts always hunger for.

[V3]
 Almighty, infinite Father,
 Faithfully loving Your own.
 Here in our weakness You find us
 Falling before Your throne;
 Oh, we're falling before Your throne.</lyrics>
