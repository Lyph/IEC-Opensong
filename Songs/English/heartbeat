<lyrics>[V1]
 Tell me all Your secrets
 Tell me everything
 Show me how to love You
 Show me how to live

[P1]
   Wherever I go, whatever I lose
   All I want is to be with You

[C1]
   I wanna know Your heartbeat, heartbeat
   Show me how Your heart beats, heart beats
   The rhythm of Your love is for me
   I wanna know Your, I wanna know Your heartbeat

[V2]
 You capture my attention
 With love so wild and free
 You light my soul on fire
 I'm burning with Your dreams

[B1]
   Wherever I go, whatever I lose
   All I want is to be with you
   Wherever I go, whatever I lose
   All I want is to be with you</lyrics>
