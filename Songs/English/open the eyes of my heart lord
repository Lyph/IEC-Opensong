 Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.

 Open the eyes of my heart.

 I want to see You. I want to see You. (2X)

[C1]
.             D               Em
   To see You high and lifted up,
.  C                            D
   Shining in the light of Your glory;
.  D                       Em
   Pour out Your power and love,
.             C           D    G
   As we sing holy, holy, holy.

   Holy, holy, holy...
