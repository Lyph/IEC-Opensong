.Am2               C
 The mistakes I've made
.            Am2
 That caused pain
.             G
 I could have done without.
.       Dm
 All my selfish thoughts,
.       C                   Dm
 All my pride, the things I hide,
.F
 You have forgot about.

[C1]
.  C
   They're all behind you.
.  Am2
   They'll never find you.
.  G                    C
   They're on the ocean floor.
.       C
   Your sins are forgotten.
.  Am
   They're on the bottom
.  G            C
   Of the ocean floor.

[V2]
.Am2   C             Am2
 My misdeeds, all my greed,
.        G
 All the things that haunt me now,
.Dm                            C
 They're not a pretty sight to see.
.                   Dm
 But they're wiped away
.     F
 By a mighty, mighty wave,
.  F
 A mighty, mighty wave, yeah!

[C2]
.       C
   Your sins are erased.
.      Am2
   And they are no more.
.          G                C
   They're out on the ocean floor.

[B1]
.  C7sus4     C    C7sus4       C
   Take them away, to return no more.
.  C7sus4     C   F
   Take them away to the ocean floor.
.  F
   To the ocean floor.
.  F
   To the ocean floor.

[B2]
.       C
   Your sins are forgotten.
.  Am
   They're on the bottom
.  G            C
   Of the ocean floor.
.       C
   Your sins are erased
.      Am2
   And they are no more.
.          G                C
   They're out on the ocean floor.
