<lyrics>[V1]
.G       Am7
 Be patient, be ready,
.G        Am7
 Look up, the Lord is near.
.G   Am7
 Be faithful, be fruitful,
.G      F       C G
 Until the day that He appears.

[V2]
.G       Am7
 Though all things are shaken
.G       Am7
 And hearts are filled with fear,
.G     Am7
 Keep working, keep praying
.Dsus      D
 Until His kingdom is here!

[V3]
.G        C      G
 Deep in our hearts there's a cry
.   Am7   D
 As the Spirit and Bride say:
.  G   C      G
 Come, Jesus! Come, take Your white horse
.     Am7      Dsus  D  G
 And ride through the heavens, come!</lyrics>
