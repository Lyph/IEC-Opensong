 She rocked her tiny baby to warm him from the cold
 Hardly what she pictured In the prophecies of old
 It seemed almost impossible to think it could be true
 But as she pondered in her heart She knew

[C1]
   This was heaven's child, this was heaven's child
   In an earthen vessel wrapped in Glory, meek and mild
   Joseph wept with wonder as Mary sweetly smiled
   Because they knew this was heaven's child

[V2]
 The angels must have missed Him as they sang Him to sleep
 But they marveled at the promises this baby came to keep
 His Father must have felt at once great sadness and great joy
 As He watched His little baby boy

[C2]
   This was heaven's child, this was heaven's child
   In an earthen vessel wrapped in Glory, meek and mild
   Joseph wept with wonder as Mary sweetly smiled
   Because they knew this was heaven's child

[B1]
   Mary's little baby boy was Joseph's pride and joy
   Still they wished the world would see He was so much more

[C3]
   He was heaven's child, He was heaven's child
   In an earthen stable wrapped in glory, meek and mild
   Joseph wept with wonder as Mary sweetly smiled
   Because they knew this was heaven's child

[V3]
 Because they knew this was heaven's child</lyrics>
