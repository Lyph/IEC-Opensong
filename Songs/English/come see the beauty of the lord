.G             C             G     C G
 Come see the beauty of the Lord, (echo)
.               C            G       C Em
 Come see the beauty of His face. (echo)
.                             C        Em
 See the Lamb that once was slain, (echo)
.                                 C       Em
 See on His palms is carved your name. (echo)
.                                  G        Em
 See how our pain has pierced His heart, (echo)
.                             Cmaj7     Em
 And on His brow He bears our pride; (echo)
.    F        D
 A crown of thorns.

[V2]
.G         C                    G     C  G
 But only love pours from His heart, (echo)
.          C                G     C Em
 As silently He takes the blame. (echo)
.                         C        Em
 He has my name upon His lips, (echo)
.                          C       Em
 My condemnation falls on Him. (echo)
.                            G      Em
 This love is marvellous to me, (echo)
.                          Cmaj7   Em
 His sacrifice has set me free (echo)
.     F     D
 And now I live!</lyrics>
