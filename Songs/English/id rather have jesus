<lyrics>[V1]
.    Bb                     Eb/G      Bb
 I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold;
.    Bb        Bb/D          F/C    Bb  F
 I'd rather be His than have riches un__told;
.    Bb                     Eb/G      Bb
 I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands.
.    Bb        Bb/E       Bb/G F       Bb
 I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand.

[V2]
.    Bb                     Eb/G    Bb
 I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause;
.    Bb             Bb/D   F/C Bb   F
 I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause;
.    Bb                     Eb/G       Bb

[V3]
.     Bb                    Eb/G   Bb
 He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom;
.     Bb             Bb/D     F/C Bb  F
 He's sweeter than honey from out the comb;
.     Bb                    Eb/G   Bb
 He's all that my hungering spirit needs.
.    Bb            Bb/E    Bb/G F   Bb
 I'd rather have Jesus and let  Him lead.

[C1]
.          F/C    F         Gm     Bb
   Than to be the king of a vast domain
.         F/C     F           Eb/Bb Bb
   And be held in sin's dread sway__.
.      Bb                     Eb/Bb Bb
   I'd rather have Jesus than any___thing
.       Bb/F    F       Eb/Bb Bb
   This world affords today.</lyrics>
