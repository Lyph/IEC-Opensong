 Verse: 1
.         G2                    D
 Before I call, before I ever cry
.           Hm                       Asus
 You answer me from where the thunder hides
.         G2                             D
 I cannot run, this heart I'm tethered to
.            Hm                  Asus
 With every step I collide with You

[C1]
   Chorus:
.  G2               D
   Like a tidal wave crashing over me
.  Hm7                     Asus
   Rushing in to meet me here your love is fierce!
.  G2              D
   Like a hurricane that I can't escape
.  Hm7                      Asus
   Tearing through the atmosp here your love is fierce!

[V2]

 You cannot fail, the only thing I've found
.               Hm                  Asus
 Is through it all You never let me down
.                G2                      D
 You don't hold back, relentless in pursuit
.           Hm                           Asus
 And every turn I come face to face with You
