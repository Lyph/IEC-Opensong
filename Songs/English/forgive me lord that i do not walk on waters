<lyrics>[V1]
 Forgive me, Lord, that I do not walk on waters,
 Although I could go - You gave me power.
 Even if the whole nature is against it,
 I would go on the waves, as You already walked.

[C1]
   You gave everything, gave me strength,
   I have so much!
   Though my spirit is so small, You expected
   I can live just like You...

[V2]
 By faith unearthly, to be dare with You -
 Everything could be done, I could do everything...

[V3]
 Forgive me, Lord, that I do not move mountains -
 What to say about them? Even stone is heavy for me...
 By Your Word they are ready to melt,
 But I know: the Holy Spirit has come down for this.

[V4]
 Forgive me, Lord, that I do not resurrect
 Those who wounded by a poisoned arrow of the world.
 That I do not multiply your bread with only one prayer
 To share life with a hungry crowd.</lyrics>
