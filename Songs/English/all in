<lyrics>[V1]
 My feet are frozen on this middle ground
 The water's warm here but the fire's gone out
 I played it safe for so long the passion left
 Turns out safe is just another word for regret

[P1]
   So, I step to the edge and I take a deep breath
   We're all dying to live but we're all scared to death
   And this is the part where my head tells my heart
   You should turn back around but there's no turning back now

[C1]
   I'm going all in Headfirst into the deep end
   I hear You calling and this time the fear won't win
   I'm going, I'm going all in
   (I'm going, I'm going...) all in
   (I'm going, I'm going)

[V2]
 I believe that one day I will see Your kingdom come
 And I wanna hear You say, &quot;Welcome home my child, well done&quot;

[P2]
   So, I step to the edge and I take a deep breath
   I'm not turning back around 'cause there's no turning back now

[C2]
   I'm going all in Headfirst into the deep end
   I hear You calling and this time the fear won't win
   I'm going, I'm going all in
   (I'm going, I'm going...) all in
   (I'm going, I'm going...) all in
   (I'm going, I'm going...) all in
   (I'm going, I'm going)

[B1]
   All to You, Jesus, I freely give
   As long as there's breath in these lungs I will live
   With reckless abandon, my heart in Your hands
   I surrender it all, I'm going... (I'm going all in)
   (I'm going, I'm going all in)

[C3]
   I'm going all in Headfirst into the deep end
   I hear You calling and this time the fear won't win
   I'm going, I'm going all in
   (I'm going, I'm going...) all in
   (I'm going, I'm going...) all in
   (I'm going, I'm going...) all in
   (I'm going, I'm going)

[V3]
 Endining:
 I believe that one day I will see Your kingdom come
 And I wanna hear You say, &quot;Welcome home my child, well done&quot;</lyrics>
