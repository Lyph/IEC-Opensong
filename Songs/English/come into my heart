<title>Come Into my Heart</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 Come into my heart, blessed Jesus,
 Come into my heart, I pray;
 My soul is so troubled and weary,
 Come into my heart today.

[C1]
   Into my heart, into my heart,
   Come into my heart, Lord Jesus;
   Come in today,
   Come in to stay,
   Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.

[V2]
 Come into my heart, blessed Jesus,
 I need Thee thro' life's dreary way;
 The burden of sin is so heavy,
 Come into my heart to stay.

[V3]
 Come into my heart, blessed Jesus,
 And take all my guilt away;
 Then spotless I'll stand in Thy presence,
 When breaks Thine eternal day.

[V4]
 Come into my heart, blessed Jesus,
 O cleanse and illumine my soul;
 Fill me with Thy wonderful Spirit,
 Come in and take full control.</lyrics>
