 [Intro]
 I am a Christian and my name is Pilgrim
 I'm on a journey but I'm not alone
 Jesus is with me and He goes before me
 And His love surrounds me, He's leading me Home

[V2]
 [Verse 1]
 One step at a time for now
 Just keep your feet on the ground
 Don't lose your way chasing the crowd
 Here's where your road begins
 Don't stop don't settle in
 Just tell yourself there's something more than this
 Just tell yourself there's something more than this
 Everybody say ...

[V3]
 [Chorus 1]
 I am a Christian and my name is Pilgrim
 I'm on a journey but I'm not alone
 Jesus is with me and He goes before me
 And His love surrounds me, He's leading me Home
 Walk o-on, walk o-on (traveler)
 Walk o-on, walk on

[V4]
 [Verse 2]
 Head high keep your eyes above
 Don't think of giving up
 He brought you this far He won't stop now
 Don't ever run away no matter what you face
 Don't be afraid 'cause He will not back down
 Remind yourself that He is with you now
 And say ...

[V5]
 [Chorus 2]
 I am a Christian and my name is Pilgrim
 I'm on a journey but I'm not alone
 Jesus is with me and He goes before me
 And His love surrounds me, He's leading me Home
 Walk o-on, walk o-on
 Walk o-on, walk on (traveler)
 Walk o-on, walk o-on
 Walk o-on, walk on (Christian ...)

[V6]
 [Bridge]
 Walk on in your weakness
 Walk on through the night
 Walk on in the darkness
 Till you see the Light
 Remember who's with you
 Remember He's strong
 And when you are weary
 He'll carry you on
 Walk on in your weakness
 Walk on through the night
 Walk on in the darkness
 Till you see the Light
 And remember who's with you
 Remember He's strong
 And when you are weary
 He'll carry you on!!!
 Everybody say ...

[V7]
 [Chorus 3]
 I am a Christian and my name is Pilgrim
 I'm on a journey but I'm not alone
 Jesus is with me and He goes before me
 And His love surrounds me, He's leading me Home
 Walk o-on, walk o-on
 Walk o-on, walk on (Christian)
 Walk o-on, walk o-on
 Walk o-on, walk on</lyrics>
