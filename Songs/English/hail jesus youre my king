<lyrics>[V1]
 Hail Jesus! You're my King!
 Your life frees me to sing
 I will praise You all of my days
 You're perfect in all Your ways

[V2]
 Hail Jesus! You're my Lord!
 I will obey Your word
 I want to see Your kingdom come
 Not my will but Yours be done

[V3]
 Glory, glory to the Lamb!
 You take me into the land
 We will conquer in Your name
 And proclaim that &quot;Jesus reigns!&quot;

[V4]
 Hail, hail! Lion of Judah!
 How powerful You are!
 Hail, hail! Lion of Judah!
 How wonderful You are!</lyrics>
