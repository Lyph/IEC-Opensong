.D G     C2    D  G     C2
 I am so tired of compromising,
.D G     C2    D  G        C2
 I am so tired of lukewarm living;
.D  G      C2 D    G         C2
 So here I am with arms wide open,
.D    G      C2  D  G          C2
 Lord here I am, my heart wide open.

[C1]
.  D   G     C2
   Set me on fire,
.  D   G     C2
   Set me on fire;
.  D   G     C2
   Set me on fire,
.  D   G     C2
   Set me on fire.

[B1]
.  Em   D             C2
   Take this heart of mine,
.  Em         D      C
   Place Your love inside;
.  Em        D              C2
   I want to go against the grain,
.  Em        D              C2
   I want to go against the grain.</lyrics>
