 Lord of eternity,
 Mystery behind the veil,
 Lord over heaven and earth,
 God of Israel.

[V2]
 Come with Your wisdom and power,
 Clothed in Your honor and strength,
 Lord, hear the cry of our hearts,
 Come, O conquering King!

[P1]
   And every eye will see Your glory fill the sky...

[C1]
   Adonai! Adonai!
   Every knee will bow to You, Lord Most High!
   Adonai! Adonai!
   You alone are God every tongue will cry, Adonai!

[V3]
 Here Jerusalem waits,
 Praises lifted on high.
 Here the beautiful gates
 Long to see you arise!

[P2]
   When all of Zion sings &quot;Blessed Is the Lord!&quot;

[B1]
   You are Lord over all the earth;
   You are Lord over all the earth.</lyrics>
