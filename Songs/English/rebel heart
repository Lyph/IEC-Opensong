 Lord I offer up this rebel heart
 So stubborn and so restless from the start
 I don't wanna fight You anymore
 So take this rebel heart and make it Yours

[V2]
 Father I no longer wanna run
 You've broken my resistance with Your love
 And drowned it underneath the crimson spill
 So bend this rebel heart into Your will

[C1]
   I give it over to You
   I give it over to You
   Your love is like an arrow, straight and true
   And now this rebel heart belongs to You

[V3]
 Help me lay the renegade to rest
 Turn the stone inside me back to flesh
 And hold me till my best defenses fall
 And watch this rebel heart surrender all

[C2]
   I give it over to You
   I give it over to You
   Your love is like an arrow, straight and true
   And now this rebel heart belongs to You

[B1]
   Oh take my life and let it be Yours
   Oh take my life and let it be Yours
   Oh take my life and let it be Yours
   Oh take my life and let it be Yours

[C3]
   I give it over to You
   I give it over to You
   Your love is like an arrow, straight and true
   And now this rebel heart belongs to You
   And now this rebel heart belongs to You
   And now this rebel heart belongs to You</lyrics>
