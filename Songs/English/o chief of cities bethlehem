<lyrics>[V1]
 O chief of cities, Bethlehem, Of David's crown the fairest gem, But more to us than David's name, In you, as man, the Savior came.

[V2]
 Beyond the sun in splendor bright, Above you stands a wondrous light Proclaiming from the conscious skies That here, in flesh, the Godhead lies.

[V3]
 The wise men, seeing Him so fair, Bow low before Him, and with prayer Their treasured eastern gifts unfold Of incense, myrrh, and royal gold.

[V4]
 The golden tribute owns Him King, But frankincense to God they bring, And last, prophetic sign, with myrrh, They shadow forth His sepulcher.

[V5]
 O Jesus, whom the Gentiles see, With Father, Spirit, One in Three: To You, O God, be glory giv'n By saints on earth and saints in Heav'n.</lyrics>
