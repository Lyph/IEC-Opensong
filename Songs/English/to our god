 Up from the ashes Your love has brought us
 Out of the darkness into the light
 Lifting our sorrows
 Bearing our burdens healing our hearts

[V2]
 To our God we lift up one voice
 To our God we lift up one song
 To our God we lift up one voice
 Singing Hallelujah

[V3]
 Chains have been broken eyes have been opened
 An army of dry bones is starting to rise
 Death is defeated
 We are victorious for You are alive
 Hallelujah Hallelujah (repeat)

[B1]
   Bridge:
   We'll make His praise glorious glorious, glorious
   For His name is glorious, glorious, glorious
   Make His praise glorious, glorious, glorious
   Shout His name Glorious, Glorious, Glorious</lyrics>
