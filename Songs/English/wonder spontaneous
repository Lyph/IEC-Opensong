<lyrics>[V1]
 May we never lose our wonder
 May we never lose our wonder
 Wide eyed and mystified
 May we be just like a child
 Staring at the beauty of our King

[V2]
 Ooooh oh oh
 Fill us with wonder
 May we never lose our wonder
 May we never lose our wonder
 Wide eyed and mystified
 May we be just like a child
 Staring at the beauty of our King

[V3]
 Cause you are beautiful in all your ways
 King of Kings
 You are beautiful in all your ways
 Ooooh
 Cause you are beautiful in all your ways
 Just close your eyes
 Just close your eyes, you'll see him
 You are beautiful in all your ways
 Open the eyes of our heart to see you God

[V4]
 May we never lose our wonder
 May we never lose our wonder
 Wide eyed and mystified
 May we be just like a child
 Staring at the beauty of our King

[V5]
 Cause you are beautiful in all your ways
 Oh you are, yes you are
 You are beautiful in all your ways
 We give our lives to sing
 Oooh oh oh
 Cause you are beautiful in all your ways
 Ooooooh
 Cause you are beautiful in all your ways
 Oooooooooooh
 You fascinate me
 You fascinate us
 You fascinate us, with you are
 You fascinate us
 You fascinate us
 You fascinate us with your love
 You are beautiful
 You are glorious
 You are beautiful
 Yes you are
 You are beautiful
 You are glorious
 You are beautiful

[V6]
 You are beautiful in all your ways
 You are beautiful in all your ways

[V7]
 May we never lose our wonder</lyrics>
