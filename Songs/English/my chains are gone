<lyrics>[V1]
. C                F         C                               G
 Amazing Grace how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me
.  C                 F        C                   G     C
 I once was lost but now I am found was blind but now I see

[V2]
.      C                    F        C                         G
 'Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved
.    C                 F       C               G       C
 How precious did that Grace appear the hour I first believed.

[C1]
.                 F                  C
   My Chains are gone; I've been set free
.             F                  C
   My God my Savior has ransomed me
.              F               C
   And like a flood His mercy reigns
.            C    G         C
   Unending love,  Amazing Grace

[V3]
.     C                 F      C                      G
 The Lord has promised good to me, His word my hope secures
.   C                  F       C              G       C
 He will my shield and portion be, as long as life endures

[V4]
.     C                  F           C                       G
 The earth shall soon dissolve like snow, the sun forbear to shine
.    C                 F      C               G     C
 But God who called me here below, Will be forever mine</lyrics>
