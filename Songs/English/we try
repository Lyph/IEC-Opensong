 There, so there you're standing in a room
 With a million things to do,
 And more places left to go
 You think you're always on your own
 There's no one else to hold your hand
 So you throw your life away

[C1]
   We try to live this life out on our own
   We die never knowing what we'd know
   We try

[V2]
 You, you have so much to pursue
 You want to be all you can be
 With the fame and the money
 But at night you lay alone
 Your heart is trembling as you think
 Is this all I'll ever be?</lyrics>
