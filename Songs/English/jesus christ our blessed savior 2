<lyrics>[V1]
 Jesus Christ, who came to save, And overcame the grave, Is now arisen, And sin hath bound in prison. Kyri' eleison.

[V2]
 Who withouten sin was found, Bore our transgression's wound. He is our Savior, And brings us to God's favor.

[V3]
 Life and mercy, sin and death, All in His hands He hath; Them He'll deliver, Who trust in Him forever.</lyrics>
