 Intro:

[V2]
 Verse:
.Asus               Hm                    G                       D
 When night has fallen when fear is common still You're calling me
.Asus                  Hm                  G                  D
 When faith is lost and my hope exhausted You will be my strength

[C1]
   Pre Chorus:
.          Asus               Hm
   When my mind says I'm not good enough
.        G                  D
   God, You're enough for me
.        Asus           Hm
   I've decided I'm not giving up
.              G
   'Cause You won't give up on me, You won't give up on me

[C2]
   Chorus:
.     Asus                             Hm
   Your love is holding on and it won't let go
.     G                           D
   I feel it breaking out like an echo
.     Asus                              Hm
   Your love is holding on and it won't let go
.     G                           D
   I feel it breaking out like an echo

[C3]
   Post Chorus:
.             Hm       G
   Echo in my so-o-o-o-oul

[V3]
 2 verse:
.Asus          Hm                 G              D
 In every season You keep repeating promises to me
.Asus                 Hm                      G              D
