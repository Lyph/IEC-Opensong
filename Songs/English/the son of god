 The Son of God

[V2]
 The Son of God came down and laid aside His crown
 Born without great renown, this Sovereign One
 All holiness and might, all glory shining bright
 Have come to earth this night in Mary's son
 O come, let us adore

[V3]
 CHORUS
 O Christ the Lord, our hope and Savior
 Son of God yet made like us
 O Christ the Lord, our King adored
 Born a child, our Lord Jesus

[V4]
 Messiah born so small, asleep in cattle stall
 Come to redeem our fall, nailed to a tree
 This tiny, helpless child through death would reconcile
 The holy God and vile, His grace so free
 O come, let us adore</lyrics>
