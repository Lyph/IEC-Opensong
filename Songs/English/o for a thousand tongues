<lyrics>[V1]
 O for a thousand tongues to sing My great Redeemer's praise, The glories of my God and King, The triumphs of His grace!

[V2]
 My gracious Master and my God, Assist me to proclaim, To spread through all the earth abroad The honors of Thy name.

[V3]
 Jesus! the name that charms our fears, That bids our sorrows cease; 'Tis music in the sinner's ears, 'Tis life, and health, and peace.

[V4]
 He breaks the pow'r of canceled sin, He sets the prisoner free; His blood can make the foulest clean, His blood availed for me.

[V5]
 He speaks, and, listening to His voice, New life the dead receive, The mournful, broken hearts rejoice, The humble poor believe.</lyrics>
