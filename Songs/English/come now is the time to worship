.   D                     G     D
 Come, now is the time to worship.
.   A                     Em        G
 Come, now is the time to give your heart.
.   D                     G    D
 Come, just as you are to worship.

 Come, just as you are before your God,
.   D

.   G                        D
   One day every tongue will confess You are God.
.   G                      D
   One day every knee will bow.
.    G                          Bm
   Still, the greatest treasure remains for those
.      Em                A
   Who gladly choose You now.</lyrics>
