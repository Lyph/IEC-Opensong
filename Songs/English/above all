<lyrics>[V1]
.G         C     D           G
 Above all powers, above all kings,
.G         C          D           G      D/F#
 Above all nature and all created things.
.          Em     Em/D                C  G/B
 Above all wisdom and all the ways of man,
.Am            Am/G             D/F#
 You were here before the world began.

[V2]
.G         C         D         G
 Above all kingdoms, above all thrones.
.G         C            D              G    D/F#
 Above all wonders this world has ever known.
.          Em     Em/D                 C    G/B
 Above all wealth and treasures of the earth,
.Am                Am/G                B
 There's no way to measure what you're worth.

[C1]
.  G    Am    D               G
   Crucified, laid behind the stone,
.      G         Am      D          G
   You lived and died, rejected and alone.
.         Em    Em/D            C    G/B
   Like a rose, trampled on the ground
.               Am G/B               C   D     G
   You took the fall, and thought of me, above all.</lyrics>
