<lyrics>[V1]
 Blest be the tie that binds Our hearts in Christian love; The fellowship of kindred minds Is like to that above.

[V2]
 Before our Father's throne We pour our ardent prayers; Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one Our comforts and our cares.

[V3]
 We share each other's woes, Our mutual burdens bear; And often for each other flows The sympathizing tear.

[V4]
 When we asunder part, It gives us inward pain; But we shall still be joined in heart, And hope to meet again.

[V5]
 This glorious hope revives Our courage by the way; While each in expectation lives, And longs to see the day.

[V6]
 From sorrow, toil and pain,
 And sin, we shall be free,
 And perfect love and friendship reign
 Through all eternity.</lyrics>
