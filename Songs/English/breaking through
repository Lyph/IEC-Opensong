 Your love is like a sunrise
 Shattering the dark of night
 Your presence is a paradise
 To our hearts

[V2]
 You're filling all the world with light
 You're making every wrong thing right
 You're waking up the dead to life
 With You love

[V3]
 God You're always breaking through the dark
 Breaking into lives and healing hearts
 Your love has torn the veil
 Your love can never fail
 Your love is making all things new

[V4]
 Your love is an eternal fire
 A jealous and a pure desire
 Strong enough to be the sacrifice
 That set us free

[V5]
 You have taken all our sins away
 You have risen and You've won the day
 God You have broken every bond and chain
 Yes, in Your love

[V6]
 God You're always breaking through the dark

[V7]
 Breaking into lives and healing hearts
 Your love has torn the veil
 Your love can never fail
 Your love is making all things new

[V8]
 So we lift up one voice
 We lift up one voice
 We sing and we shout for joy

[V9]
 For now we are Yours
 Yes, our hearts are Yours
 You've ransomed us with Your blood

[V10]
 God You're always breaking through the dark
 Breaking into lives and healing hearts
 Your love has torn the veil
 Your love can never fail
 Your love is making all things new</lyrics>
