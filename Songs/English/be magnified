.G      Em           D           Am    G/B C   D    Em
 I have made You too small in my eyes, O   Lord, forgive me;
.Em/B Em       D           Am   G/B  C          D       Em
 And  I have believed in a lie, That You were unable to help me.

[V2]
.G      Em            D         Am   G/B C   D    Em
 I have leaned on the wisdom of men, O   Lord, forgive me;
.Em/B Em       D          Am    G/B C             D              Em
 And  I have responded to them, In__stead of Your light and Your mercy.

   But  now, O Lord, I see my wrong, Heal my heart and show Yourself strong;

   And in my eyes and with my song,
.             D    Em
   O Lord, be magnified;

   O Lord, be mag__nified.
