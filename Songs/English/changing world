 I thought I had it all under control
 I thought my fate was still in my hands
 All of my plans were firmly set
 By the words that I say

[P1]
   I forgot how quickly things can change
   Now my vision can not be the same

[C1]
   My life is not what I thought
   I'm not where I planned to be
   Though something's gone
   There's nothing wrong with my changing world
   Though something's gone
   There's nothing wrong with my changing world

[V2]
 I need to let go of my destiny
 I need to trust in things unseen
 I believe in having faith
 Though I yield my control

[B1]
   I'm embracing all of my fears
   I am watching them turn to delight
   The very fears which were gripping my mind
   Are now the hands shaping and sculpting my dreams</lyrics>
