<lyrics>[V1]
 I bow my knee in reverence, in awe of Your glory;
 Humbly I approach You now, with praise and adoration.
 I lift my hands in worship, giving You all honor;
 I'll join the heavenly hosts of angels now and sing:

[C1]
   Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,
   Who was and is and is to come.
   The Lion of Judah, the soon and coming King;
   Jesus, You are crowned with praise.</lyrics>
