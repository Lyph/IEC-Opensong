<lyrics>[V1]
.A
 You stood before creation,
. D
 Eternity in Your hand.
.A/C#                      F#m
 You spoke the earth into motion,
.              D
 My soul now to stand.

[V2]
.A
 You stood before my failure
.    D
 And carried the cross for my shame.
.   A/C#                    F#m
 My sin weighed upon Your shoulders,
.              D
 My soul now to stand.

[P1]
.                  D Bm
   So what can I say,
.                    F#m
   And what could I do,
.                     D        E
   But offer this heart, O God,
.                F#m
   Completely to You?

[V3]
.   A
 So I'll walk upon salvation,
.     D
 Your Spirit alive in me,
.     A/C#                  F#m
 This life to declare Your promise,
.              D
 My soul now to stand.

[C1]
.  D         A
   So I'll stand
.       E             F#m           D
   With arms high and heart abandoned,
.     A          E       F#m         D
   In awe of the One who gave it all.
.        A
   I'll stand,
.     E              F#m
   My soul, Lord, to You surrendered;
.  D     A         E (F#m)
   All I am is Yours.</lyrics>
