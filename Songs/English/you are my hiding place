<lyrics>[V1]
.Am      Dm    G
 You are my hiding place,
.         C
 You always fill my heart
.     F    Dm
 With songs of deliverance,
.    E  Am E
 Whenever I am afraid

[V2]
.       Am Dm
 I will trust in You,
.         G C
 I will trust in You;
.           F  Dm
 Let the weak say: 'I am strong
.     E     Am   E
 In the strength of my Lord.'</lyrics>
