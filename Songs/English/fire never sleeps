 I feel the heat is rising
 The flames on the horizon
 Are at my door
 I'm staring at the ruins
 The embers of our brokenness
 Scattered on the floor
 This fire never sleeps
 This fire never sleeps
 I see that hope is coming
 To pull me from the ashes
 Ignite my soul
 Please burn away the darkness
 Cause love is like a furnace
 Where Your fire never sleeps
 Burn O my soul
 Set me on fire
 Burn O my soul
 Light up the fire
 Burn O my soul
 Stop
 I never want to miss You
 Something new is being born
 And we were born for this
 Lord, we know a day is coming
 When we'll look into Your eyes
 And see Your fire that never sleeps
 Your fire never sleeps
 Your fire never sleeps
 Burn O my soul
 Set me on fire
 Burn O my soul
 Light up the fire
 Burn O my soul
 Your fire never sleeps
 Your fire never sleeps
 Purify my heart
 Purify my heart
 Spirit fall on us
 Spirit fall on us
 Burn O my soul
 Set me on fire
 Burn O my soul
 Light up the fire
 Burn O my soul
 Your fire never sleeps
 Your fire never sleeps
 Your fire never sleeps
 Your fire never sleeps</lyrics>
