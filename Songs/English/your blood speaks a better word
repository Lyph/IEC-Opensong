.     B2                    G#m7
 Your blood speaks a better word
.                    B2                         G#m7
 Than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth
.                         F#
 Speaks righteousness for me
.                    E
 and stands in my defence
.                  B2 G#m7F#
 Jesus it's your blood

[C1]
.  B2
   What can wash away our sins?
.  G#m7
   What can make us whole again?
.  F#
   Nothing but the blood
.  E                        B2   F#
   Nothing but the blood of Jesus
.  E
    
.  B2
   What can wash us pure as snow?
.  G#m7
   Welcomed as the friends of God?
.  F#
   Nothing but your blood
.  E                           B2
   Nothing but your blood King Jesus

[V2]
.     B2                 G#m7
 Your cross testifies in grace
.                      B2                      G#m7
 Tells of the Father's heart to make a way for us
.                F#
 Now boldly we approach
.                    E
 Not by earthly confidence
.                  B2 G#m7 F#
 It's only by Your blood___</lyrics>
