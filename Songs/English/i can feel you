 The wind and waves surround me
 And I'm tossed, Feel like I'm drowning
 I am tired, I am weak
 I need you here with me
 'Cause I can feel the rising tide
 But I don't have the strength to fight
 I feel clouded and confused
 I need you here with me

[V2]
 In thechaos of the storm
 I have drifted far; far away
 But I call out your name
 'Cause you are just a breath
 A breath away

[V3]
 Then through the shadows
 Your light appears
 I've known you're with me
 But now it is clear
 I can feel you
 Jesus All around

[V4]
 Like sun on my skin
 Warm to the touch
 Here you surround me
 I am held by love
 I can feel you
 Jesus all around

[V5]
 Now hope is rushing through my veins
 With everything you've rearranged
 I am peaceful; I am brave
 When you're here with me

[V6]
 All my questions find their answers here
 When you come you change the atmosphere
 I am focused; I am clear
 When you're here with me

[B1]
   Bridge:-
   There is nothing in this world
   That will satisfy my soul like you do (2)

[V7]
 Then through the shadows
 You're light appears
 I've known you're with me
 But now its is clear
 I can feel you
 Jesus all around
 Like sun on my skin
 Warm to the touch
 Here you surround me
 I am held by love
 I can feel you
 Jesus all around

[V8]
 Though the storm it rages
 I won't be moved
 I won't be shaken
 I'm anchored in you
 I can feel you
 Jesus all around</lyrics>
