.Em     Dsus            Gsus G  Em            Dsus               G
 In open fields of wild flowers, she breathes the air and flies away.
.G                            Em              Dsus  G
 She thanks her Jesus for the daisies and the roses in no simple language.
.Em      Dsus             G
 Someday she'll understand the meaning of it all.

[P1]
.  Fsus                                G            Gsus
   He is more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens,
.     Fsus                    G           Gsus
   As close as a heartbeat or song on her lips.
.  G
    
.  Fsus                      G
   Someday she'll trust Him, learn how to see Him.
.  Fsus                       Am7
   Someday He'll call her and she will come running
.      Abmaj7                Em7             Dsus            G
   And fall in His arms, the tears will fall down and she'll pray,

[C1]
.  G         C2                Am7
   I want to fall in love with You.
.            Em7     Dsus      G
   I want to fall in love with You.
.            C2                Am7
   I want to fall in love with You.
.            Em7     Dsus      Em7
   I want to fall in love with You-
.  D   G             Em7 D   G
   hoo-hoo! Ooo-hoo! You-hoo-hoo!

[V2]
.Em  D                  Gsus       G Em      Dsus                G
 Sitting silent wearing Sunday best.  The sermon echoes thru the walls;
.G                         Em           Dsus
 A great salvation thru it calls to the people
.    G
 who stare into nowhere,
.Em             Dsus            G
 Can't feel the chains on their souls.

[P2]
.  Fsus                                G            Gsus
   He is more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens,
.     Fsus                    G           Gsus G
   As close as a heartbeat or song on our lips.
.  Fsus                     G
   Someday we'll trust Him, learn how to see Him.
.  Fsus                      Am7
   Someday He'll call us and we will come running
.      Abmaj7                Em7             Dsus           G
   And fall in His arms, the tears will fall down and we'll pray,

[B1]
.           Em7 (D G)
   Ooo-hoo! You...
.  Em7 D       G
   We  want to pray! Hi-gh!
.  Am7      G        Em
   La la la la la la la, a
.        Dsus      Am7
   La la la, la la la,
.        G        Em
   La la la la la la la,
.           D
   La la la-ah.
.  Em        Dsus                 G      Em         Dsus                G
    It seems too easy to call You Savior, not close enough to call You &quot;God&quot;.
.  G                             Em          Dsus       G               Em DsusDG
    So as I sit and think of the words I can mention to show my devotion,</lyrics>
