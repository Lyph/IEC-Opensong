<lyrics>[V1]
 O love, how deep, how broad, how high, How passing thought and fantasy, That God, the Son of God, should take Our mortal form for mortals' sake!

[V2]
 He sent no angel to our race Of higher or of lower place, But wore the robe of human frame And He Himself, to this world came.

[V3]
 Nor willed He only to appear; His pleasure was to tarry here; And God and Man with man would be The space of thirty years and three.

[V4]
 For us baptized, for us He bore His holy fast and hungered sore, For us temptations sharp He knew; For us the tempter overthrew.

[V5]
 For us He prayed; for us He taught; For us His daily works He wrought; By words and signs and actions thus Still seeking not Himself, but us.

[V6]
 For us to wicked men betrayed,
 Scourged, mocked, in crown of thorns arrayed,
 For us He bore the cross's death,
 For us at length gave up His breath.

[V7]
 For us He rose from death again;
 For us He went on high to reign;
 For us He sent His Spirit here,
 To guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.

[V8]
 All honor, laud, and glory be,
 O Jesus, virgin-born to Thee!
 All glory, as is ever meet
 To Father and to Paraclete.</lyrics>
