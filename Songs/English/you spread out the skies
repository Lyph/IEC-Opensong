<lyrics>[V1]
.C2
 You spread out the skies
 over empty space,
.E7sus
 said &quot;Let there be light.&quot;
.                                             C2   DG/B
 To a dark and formless world, Your light was born.

[V2]
.C2
 You spread out Your arms
 over empty hearts,
.Em7
 said &quot;Let there be light.&quot;
.                                           C2   D
 To a dark and hopeless world, Your Son was born.

[P1]
.      Am7                G/B              C2
   You made the world and saw that it was good.
.      Am7            G/B            C2
   You sent Your only Son for You are good.

[C1]
.  D/F#               C2
   What a wonderful Maker.
.                     Em7
   What a wonderful Savior.
.                       C2
   How majestic Your whispers,
.  D/F#                     G
   And how humble Your love.
.                            C2
   With a strength like no other,
.                       Em7
   And the heart of a Father,
.                       C2
   How majestic Your whispers.
.  D/F#             Gsus G
   What a wonderful God.

[V3]
.C2
 No eye has fully seen
.                         Em7
 how beautiful the cross, and we have only heard
.                                       C2  D
 the faintest whispers of how great You are. (2X)

[B1]
.  Gsus  G              C2
   How majestic Your whispers.
.  D/F#            C2
   What a wonderful God.</lyrics>
