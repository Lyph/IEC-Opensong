<lyrics>[V1]
 Lord of our life, and God of our salvation, Star of our night, and Hope of every nation, Hear and receive Thy church's supplication, Lord God Almighty.

[V2]
 See round Thine Ark the hungry billows curling! See how Thy foes their banners are unfurling! Lord, while their darts envenomed they are hurling, Thou canst preserve us.

[V3]
 Lord, Thou canst help when earthly armor faileth; Lord, Thou canst save when sin itself assaileth; Lord, o'er Thy Rock nor death nor hell prevaileth; Grant us Thy peace, Lord.

[V4]
 Peace, in our hearts, our evil thoughts assuaging, Peace, in Thy Church, where brothers are engaging, Peace, when the world its busy war is waging; Calm Thy foes raging!

[V5]
 Grant us Thy help till backward they are driven; Grant them Thy Truth, that they may be forgiven; Grant peace on earth, and after we have striven, Peace in Thy Heaven.</lyrics>
