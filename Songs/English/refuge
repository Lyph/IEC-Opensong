.E    B/D#              Amaj7
 Your call comes like the morning breeze;
.E     B/D#           Amaj7
 You spread Your wings and cover me.
.E/G#       Amaj7   E/G#     Amaj7
 Underneath Your shadow, I will hide away;
.E/G#            Amaj7   E/G#            Amaj7
 There I've found Your shelter, and there I'd like to stay.

   Refuge,You're my refuge;

   When the world is shaken and nothing stands,
.  E/G#         A        B  C#m E/G#   Amaj7E
   I will hold on to Your hand, Refuge.</lyrics>
