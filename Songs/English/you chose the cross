<lyrics>[V1]
.     Bb
 You chose the cross with every breath.
.     Gm7                            Eb2
 The perfect life, the perfect death,
.               Bb   F/A
 You chose the cross.
.   Bb
 A crown of thorns You wore for us
.      Gm7                        Eb2
 And crowned us with eternal life.
.               Bb   F
 You chose the cross.

[P1]
.       Cm7                      Bb/D        Fsus FBb/D
   And though your soul was overwhelmed with pain,
.     Cm7      Bb/D           Fsus F
   Obedient to death, you overcame.

[C1]
.               Bb              Gm7
   I'm lost in wonder. I'm lost in love.
.               Eb2           F
   I'm lost in praise forevermore.
.               Bb         Gm7
   Because of Jesus' unfailing love,
.            Eb2            F
   I am forgiven, I am restored.

[V2]
 You loose the cords of sinfulness
 And broke the chains of my distress.
 You chose the cross.
 And from the grave victorious,
 You rose again, so glorious.
 You chose the cross.

[P2]
   The sorrow that surrounded You was mine.
   Yet not my will, but Yours be done, You cried.</lyrics>
