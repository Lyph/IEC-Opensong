.  A   D          F#m  E     A   D          F#m  E/G#
   I'm trading my sor__rows, I'm trading my sha__me,
.  A   D           F#m          E          A    D
   I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord.
.  F#mE
    
.  A   D          F#m E     A   D          F#m  E/G#
   I'm trading my sickness, I'm trading my pain,
.  A   D           F#m          E          A    DF#mE
   I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord.

[B1]
   We say,
.   A         D         F#m       E
   &quot;Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes, Lord;
.  A         D         F#m       E/G#
   Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes, Lord;
.  A         D         F#m       E      A   D  F#mE
   Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes, Lord, Amen!&quot;__

[V1]
.    A               D             F#m        E
 I'm pressed but not crushed, persecuted not abandoned,
.A      D               F#m    E
 Struck down but not destroyed.
.     A                  D             F#m            E
 I am blessed beyond the curse for His promise will endure,
.         A           D     F#m
 That His joy's gonna be my strength.
.E
  
.E                     Esus         E
 Though the sorrow may last for the night,
.    G                  D
 His joy comes with the morning.</lyrics>
