<lyrics>[V1]
.      G
 In my heart, in my heart,
.                       D
 there's a fire burning,
.                         C
 A passion deep within my soul,
.            Am               D
 not slowing down not growing cold.
.     G
 An unquenchable flame
.                            D
 that keeps burning brighter,
.                               C
 A love that's blazing like the sun
.            Am                  D
 for who You are and what You've done.
.    C      G       D      Am
 And as the fire is raging on,
.        C      G          D
 So Your praise becomes my song.

[C1]
.            G
   The whole earth is filled
.                   D
   with Your glory, Lord.
.                  C
   Angels and men adore;
.                     G         D
   Creation longs for what's in store.
.          G                   D
   May You be honored and glorified,
.                     C
   exalted and lifted high.
.                      G      D
   Here at Your feet I lay my life.

[V2]
.         G
 From the ends of the earth
.                         D
 to the heights of heaven,
.                             C
 Your glory, Lord, is far and wide;
.           Am                D
 through history You reign on high.
.         G
 From the depths of the sea
.                         D
 to the mountain's summit,
.                              C
 Your power, Lord, it knows no bounds;
.         Am             D
 a higher love cannot be found.
.   C       G  D        Am
 So let the universe proclaim
.     C               G          D
 Your great power and Your great name.

[C2]
.            G
   The whole earth is filled
.                   D
   with Your glory, Lord.
.                           C
   Mountains bow and oceans roar;
.                     G         D
   Creation longs for what's in store.
.          G                   D
   May You be honored and glorified,
.                     C
   exalted and lifted high.
.                      G      D
   Here at Your feet I lay my life.</lyrics>
