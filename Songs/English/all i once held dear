.      Am    F    C              F   G C
 All I once held dear, built my life upon
.          Am    F C         Dm       G
 All this world reveres, and wars to own
.C   G Am     F      C             F  G   C
 All I once thought gain, I have counted loss
.           Am   F    C       Dm       Gsus G
 Spent and worthless now, compared to this__

[C1]
.           F    C    F  G      C
   Knowing You, Jesus, knowing You

   There is no greater thing

   You're my all, You're the best
.             C               Fmaj7
   You're my joy, my righteousness

   And I love You, Lord__

[V2]

 Now my heart's desire is to know You more

 To be found in You, and known as Yours
. C  G  Am   F   C            F    G    C
 To possess by faith what I could not earn
.       Am  F    C       Dm      Gsus  G
 All-surpassing gift of righteousness__

[V3]
.      Am   F   C             F G   C
 O to know the power of Your risen life

 And to know You in Your suffering
. C  G Am   F    C            F     G   C
 To become like You in Your death, my Lord
.        Am  F  C        Dm   Gsus  G
 So with You to live and never die__</lyrics>
