<lyrics>[V1]
 O Lord, my God, I thirst for You, I long to see your face, Just as the hunted deer is stressed I falter in the race; My heart cries out, my tears run down, I am in deep distress, 'Where is your God?' men say to me, They taunt me and oppress.

[V2]
 Lord, when will I be helped by You, I struggle day and night? O hear my prayer, enable me to stand in your great might; I look back on those days gone by when, Lord, You were so near, when in your house with festive throng I praised your Name so dear.

[V3]
 So why am I cast down, O Lord, and why should I feel low? You are my God, my Savior strong, Your praise from me shall flow; I think of all your works, O Lord, Your saving pow'r of old, So when beset and overwhelmed, I will your strength take hold.

[V4]
 Your loving\kindness fills my days, Your song at night I sing, And when my fears assail again to You I'll tightly cling; My hope is fixed on God, my Rock, His own He won't forget; Be still my soul, my face will shine And I will praise Him yet.</lyrics>
