<lyrics>[V1]
 The Gospel shows the Father's grace, Who sent his Son to save our race, Proclaims how Jesus lived and died That man might thus be justified.

[V2]
 It sets the Lamb before our eyes, Who made th'atoning sacrifice, And calls the souls with guilt oppressed To come and find eternal rest.

[V3]
 It brings the Savior's righteousness Our souls to robe in royal dress; From all our guilt it brings release And gives the troubled conscience peace.

[V4]
 It is the pow'r of God to save From sin and Satan and the grave; It works the faith, which firmly clings To all the treasures which it brings.

[V5]
 It bears to all the tidings glad And bids their hearts no more be sad; The heavy laden souls it cheers And banishes their guilty fears.

[V6]
 May we in faith its tidings learn
 Nor thanklessly its blessings spurn;
 May we in faith its truth confess
 And praise the Lord our Righteousness!</lyrics>
