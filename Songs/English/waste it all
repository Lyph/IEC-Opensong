 Intro:

[V2]
 Verse: 1
.C#m         E      A
 Covered in shame, hiding my face
 I owed a debt I could not pay
.C#m         E             A
 Searching in vain to fill my heart's ache
 I threw my worth away
.G#m        A
 When I thought all was lost
.     E      H
 You sought me and You came to my defense
.G#m          A
 This priceless gift You gave
.    E       H
 Was not meant for me to hold

[C1]
   Chorus: 1
.  C#m         A        E
   I want to waste it all on You
.       H           C#m
   I want to pour my heart's perfume
.           A           E
   I don't care if I'm called a fool
.           H
   I'm wasting it all on You

 Verse: 2

[V4]
 Lifting my head, holding my face
 Wiping my endless tears away
 You unlock my heart whispering grace
 How could I leave this place?
 When I'm here at Your feet
 I can feel You, all the voices fade away
 I will spend all my days
 Giving back the love You gave

[C2]
   Chorus: 2
.  C#m        A        E
   I'm gonna waste it all on You
.        H           C#m
   I'm gonna pour my heart's perfume
.           A          E
   I don't care if I'm called a fool
.           H
   I'm wasting it all on You

[B2]
   Instrumental:

[B3]
   Bridge:
.  A
   All for love and all for me
.     H
   You gave it all for me to be
.   C#m
   Alive in You and You in me
.     H
   Lord I surrender
.  A
   To Your love and to Your touch
.    H
   And to the way You give too much
.     C#m                  H
   I'm too in love to not be all for You!
