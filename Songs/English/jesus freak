<lyrics>[V1]
.Em  C         A
 Separated, I cut myself clean
.        Em              C
 from a past that comes back
.       A
 in my darkest of dreams.
.Em        C           A
 Been apprehended by a spiritual force
.      Em           C              A
 and a grace that replaced all the me I divorced.

[V2]
.Em  C         A
 Kamikaze, my death is gain.
.           Em           C          A
 I've been marked by my Maker, a peculiar display.
.Em           C           A
 The high and lofty, they see me as weak,
.         Em             C            A
 'cause I won't live and die, for the power they seek.

[C1]
.          Em                    C
   I saw a man with a tat on his big fat belly.
.     A
   It wiggled around like marmalade jelly.
.     Em                 C
   It took me a while to catch what it said,
.           A
   'cause I had to match the rhythm of his belly with my head.
.      Em               C                   A
       &quot;Jesus Saves&quot; is what it raved, in a typical tatoo green.
.     Em                    C
   He stood on a box in the middle of the city
.         A
   and he claimed he had a dream.

[C2]
.              Em                       C
   There was a man from the desert with naps in his head.
.      A
   The sand that he walked was also his bed.
.      Em                           C
   The words that he spoke made the people assume,
.        A
   there wasn't too much left in the upper room.
.       Em                    C
   With skins on his back and hair on his face,
.       A
   they thought he was strange by the locust he ate.
.             Em                          C
   Ya see the Pharisees tripped when they heard him speak,
.            A
   until the king took the head of this Jesus Freak.

[C3]
.  Em               G               D               A     Bm
   What will people think when they hear that I'm a Jesus Freak?
.  Em               G            D             A  Bm
   What will people do when they find out it's true?
.  Em             G            D          A     Bm
   I don't really care if they label me a Jesus Freak.
.  Em                G           D    A Bm
   There ain't no disguising the truth.

[B1]
.  Em             G/F           A/F
   People say I'm strange, does that make me a stranger?
.  Em      G/F        A/F       Em
   My best friend was born in a manger.
   (2x)

[B2]
.  Em               G
   What will people think?
.   D         A  Bm
   (What will people think?)
.  Em               G
   What will people do?
.   D         A  Bm
   (What will people do?)
.  Em             G
   I don't really care.
.   D         A   Bm
   (What else can I say?)
.  Em                G           D
   There ain't no disguising the truth.
.         A  Bm  Em
