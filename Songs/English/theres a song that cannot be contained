<title>There's a song that cannot be contained</title>
<lyrics>[V1]
 There's a song that cannot be contained
 There's a shout that breaks through every chain
 God, we won't be silent

[V2]
 There's a faith that rises through the flames
 There's a joy that chases the dark away
 God, we won't be silent

[P1]
   And the greater the storm
   The louder our song

[C1]
   We lift our voices, lift our voices
   Make Your praise so glorious, glorious
   We lift our voices, lift our voices
   Make Your praise so glorious

[B1]
   We'll never stop singing
   We'll never stop singing
   We'll never stop singing
   We'll never stop singing</lyrics>
