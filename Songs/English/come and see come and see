<lyrics>[V1]
.          C             G
 Come and see, come and see,
.          Bb              A
 Come and see the King of Love;
.         Dm     A         F   G    Am       Bb  G
 See the purple robe and crown of thorns He wears.
.          C              G
 Soldiers mock, rulers sneer,
.       Bb               A
 As He lifts the cruel cross;
.           Dm        A       F     G Am        Bb  G
 Lone and friendless now He climbs towards the hill.

[C1]
.      Am              Em
   We worship at your feet,
.         Fmaj7          C
   Where wrat and mercy meet,
.         Dm              A         D            Gsus G
   And a guilty world is washed by love's pure stream.
.     Am               Em
   For us He was made sin,
.     Fmaj7           C
   Oh help me take it in
.        Dm                 A       D      Gsus  G
   Deep wounds of love cry out 'Father, forgive!'
.     G#o Am     G   A        Dm7  G        C
   I worship, I worship, The Lamb who was slain.

[V2]
.           C              G
 Come and weep, come and mourn,
.         Bb                     A
 For your sin that pierced Him there;
.          Dm     A       F     G    Am       Bb  G
 So much deeper than the wounds of thorn and nail.
.          C               G
 All our pride, all our greed,
.        Bb               A
 All our fallenness and shame;
.         D         A       F G   Am      Bb G
 And the Lord has laid the punishment on Him.

[V3]
.        C               G
 Man of Heaven, born to Earth
.       Bb              A
 To restore us to Your Heaven,
.         Dm    A       F     G   Am       Bb   G
 Here we bow in awe beneath Your searching eyes.
.            C              G
 From Your tears comes our joy,
.            Bb                        A
 From your death our life shall spring,
.         Dm    A       F G  Am        Bb  G
 By Your ressurrection power we shall rise!</lyrics>
