 Praise Him, praise Him, all ye little children,
 God is love, God is love;
 Praise Him, praise Him, all ye little children,
 God is love, God is love.

[V2]
 Love Him, love Him, all ye little children,
 God is love, God is love;
 Love Him, love Him, all ye little children,
 God is love, God is love.

[V3]
 Thank Him, thank Him, all ye little children,
 God is love, God is love;
 Thank Him, thank Him, all ye little children,
 God is love, God is love.

[V4]
 I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart,
 Where?
 Down in my heart!
 Where?
 Down in my heart!
 I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart,
 Down in my heart to stay.

[V5]
 And I'm so happy,
 So very happy,
 I've got the love of Jesus in my heart,
 Down in my heart,
 And I'm so happy,
 So very happy,
 I've got the love of Jesus in my heart.</lyrics>
