 How can I say thanks
 for the things you have done for me
 Things so undeserved
 Yet you give to prove your love for me
 The voices of a million angels
 Could not express my gratitude
 All that I am and ever hope to be
 I owe it all to Thee

[C1]
   To God be the glory
   To God be the glory
   To God be the glory
   For the things He has done
   With His blood, He has saved me
   With His power, He has raised me.
   To God be the glory
   For the things he has done

[B1]
   Just let me live my life
   Let it be pleasing, Lord to Thee
   Should I gain any praise,
   Let it go to Calvary.

[V2]
 With His blood, He has saved me
 With His power, He has raised me.
 To God be the glory
 For the things he has done.</lyrics>
