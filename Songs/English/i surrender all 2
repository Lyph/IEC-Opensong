.  F#m         A/C D9A
   I surrender all,
.                         F#m A/CD9A
   To the promises You've made
.      F#m            A/C D9A
   And I will give it all,
.                      F#m  A/CD9A
   To the Maker of the day__

[V1]
.A                 D
 No one knows your hurt
.A                     D
 And No one knows your fears
.A                      D
 When no one solves the mystery
.A                       D
 Or even whipes away the tears

[V2]
.A                         D
 Can you hear the sound of laughter
.A                      D
 From the other side of life
.A                                 D
 Their are days when I feel like a stranger sometimes
.A                           D
 Tell me are there any other souls like me

[B1]
.  D9         A                 D9     A
   He doesn't love us 'cause of who we are
.  D9      A                  D9     A
   He only loves us 'cause of who He is (2x)</lyrics>
