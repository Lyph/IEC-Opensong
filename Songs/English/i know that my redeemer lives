 I know that my Redeemer lives; What comfort this sweet sentence gives! He lives, He lives, who once was dead; He lives, my ever living Head.

[V2]
 He lives to bless me with His love, He lives to plead for me above. He lives my hungry soul to feed, He lives to help in time of need.

[V3]
 He lives triumphant from the grave, He lives eternally to save, He lives all glorious in the sky, He lives exalted there on high.

[V4]
 He lives to grant me rich supply, He lives to guide me with His eye, He lives to comfort me when faint, He lives to hear my soul's complaint.

[V5]
 He lives to silence all my fears, He lives to wipe away my tears He lives to calm my troubled heart, He lives all blessings to impart.</lyrics>
