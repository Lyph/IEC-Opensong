.G              G/F#
 Many men will drink the rain
.Em                       C
 And turn to thank the clouds.
.G             G/F#
 Many men will hear You speak;
.           Em             C
 They will never turn around.

[B1]
.  G
   But I will not forget You
.  G/F#
   Are my God, my King.
.  Em7
   With a thankful heart I
.  Cmaj7
   Bring my offering.
.  G
   And my sacrifice is
.  G/F#
   Not what You can give
.  Em7
   But what I alone can
.  Cmaj7
   Give to You.

[C1]
.  G
   A grateful heart I give,
.  G/F#
   A thankful prayer I pray,
.  Em7            Cmaj7
   A wild dance I dance before You.
.  G
   A loud song I sing,
.  G/F#
   A huge bell I ring,
.  Em7                Cmaj7           CGEmCG
   A life of praise I live before You.

[V2]
 Many men will pour their gold
 And serve a thing that shines.
 Many men will read Your words;
 They will never change their minds.</lyrics>
