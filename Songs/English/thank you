 Lord, You took me into Your arms
 And You've shown me truest love
 You have given me such mercy
 I'm unworthy of

[V2]
 Lord, Your mercy everlasting
 I could never understand
 for all the love and grace You've shown
 I just want to say:

[C1]
   Thank You, thank You Dear Lord
   Thank You from the bottom of my heart
   Thank You, thank You Dear Lord
   Thank You from the bottom of my heart

[V3]
 At the cross You gave your life for me
 As a gift of Your great love
 It was the gift of everlasting life
 From above

[V4]
 I can boldly come before your throne
 Through Your blood I've been set free
 I'm going to shout it to the heavens
 I've been redeemed!</lyrics>
