.D           Bm G2                 Asus A
 Amazing grace,  how sweet the sound;___
.D          Bm G2              Asus A
 Amazing love,  now flowing down____
.G                 Asus A
 From hands and feet____
.          D      D/C#    Bm A
 That were nailed to a tree.
.G                 Asus       A  D Dsus
 As grace flows down and covers me.
