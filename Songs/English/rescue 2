 You are not hidden
 There's never been a moment You were forgotten
 You are not hopeless
 Though you have been broken Your innocence stolen

[P1]
   I hear you whisper underneath your breath
   I hear your SOS, your SOS

[C1]
   I will send out an army to find You
   In the middle of the darkest night
   It's true, I will rescue you

[V2]
 There is no distance
 That cannot be covered over and over
 You're not defenseless
 I'll be your shelter I'll be your armor

[P2]
   I hear you whisper underneath Your breath
   I hear your SOS, your SOS

[C2]
   I will send out an army to find You
   In the middle of the darkest night
   It's true, I will rescue you
   I will never stop marching to reach you
   In the middle of the hardest fight
   It's true, I will rescue you

[B1]
   I hear the whisper underneath Your breath
   I hear you whisper, you have nothing left

[C3]
   I will send out an army to find You
   In the middle of the darkest night
   It's true, I will rescue you
   I will never stop marching to reach you
   In the middle of the hardest fight
   It's true, I will rescue you

[V3]
 Oh, I will rescue you</lyrics>
