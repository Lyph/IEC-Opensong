 The Lord is my good Shepherd,
 He leads me with His perfect love.
 The Lord id my good leader.
 He's my guide, He's my God (3x - He's my Lord!)

[V2]
 You're King of my heart,
 You make me lie down
 In green pastures,
 You lead me beside
 Quiet waters.

[V3]
 You restore my soul;
 You guide me in paths
 Of righteousness
 For Your name are sake.

[V4]
 Even though
 I walk through the valley of shadow
 Of death, I fear no evil,
 For You are with me.

[V5]
 For You are with me,
 For You are with me,
 I fear no evil,
 For You are with me!

[V6]
 You are King of my heart,
 You're my Lord, You're my God,
 You lead with
 Your perfect love!

[V7]
 With Your perfect love...!

[V8]
 The Lord is my good Shepherd,
 He leads me with His perfect love.
 The Lord id my good leader.
 He's my God.</lyrics>
